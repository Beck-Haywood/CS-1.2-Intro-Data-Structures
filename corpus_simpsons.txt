Lisa's Substitute Written by Jon Vitti

Directed by Rich Moore

I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.

... the `Give a hoot! Read a book!' Krusty poster in the classroom?

... a very sick Wendell during Bart's show-and-tell, and that his cheeks

puffed out when Bart runs the tape backwards? [Mark Walsh]

... when the twins nominate Bart, he was about to shoot a triangular paper

`football' across the room?

... the cracks in the wall of the Simpsons basement? (And I have a

sneaking suspicion that the look of the staircase contradicts

`Itchy & Scratchy & Marge'.)

... when Lisa and Homer play with the static electricity exhibit, their

hair stands on end when they touch it?

... Lisa's adorable bow in her hair when she rehearses asking

Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?

... the family are eating the same purple goo (fish pork-a-roni a la

Simpson) that Homer invented in `Bart & Dad Eat Dinner'? [David Tamkin]

(We also see the purple goo in `Eating Dinner'.)

... Lisa's ergonomic chair is gone?

... Maggie finally made a sound different from sucking on her pacifier?

Watch Lisa's mouth when she says the word `have' during her final scene

with Mr. Bergstrom. She curls her lower lip into her mouth, and you can

see her teeth poking out from under her top lip. This happens also when

Mr. Bergstrom says a word with the letter `v' in it, but it's more

noticeable with Lisa.



From the 29 Apr 91 USA TODAY:



MRS. ROBINSON:

If you saw Fox's `The Simpsons' Thursday, you may have noticed a new voice

in the credits---Sam Enid [sic]. Enid's voice sure sounded familiar,

almost like Dustin Hoffman. And gee, there sure were a lot of references

in `The Simpsons' to Hoffman's first hit, `The Graduate', thrown into a

story about Lisa falling into love with her substitute teacher. Shazam!

It turns out Enid is none other than Hoffman, whose contract with `The

Simpsons' stated that his real name could not be used on the credits or in

publicity.



Marc Colten (colten@cbnewsb.cb.att.com):



* Lisa found a truly good and wise teacher---and he left.



* She called her father a baboon and Bart agreed ("... I never thought _she'd_

be the one to say it").



* Homer then goes "3 for 3". How?

- He acts like a baboon in front of his daughter. She loves him, but she'll

never respect him. His attitude was that "Yeah, I'm a baboon, learn to

live with it."

- He then went to Bart and convinced him to aim low and be a jerk the rest

of his life. What an accomplishment.

- Then he gives his baby daughter her pacifier. Wow, what a father!



I don't think there's much to "feel good" about this episode. As Lisa

observed in another episode [Dead Putting Society], she'll be telling all this

to a psychiatrist some day.



Paul Kornreich (etzhadat@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu):



One of the important themes of this show was to respect people as they are and

not try to mold them into the ideal images that we want them to be. The main

example is of course Lisa's need for understanding throughout the episode.

However, just as important, except slightly more hidden, is the fact that she

must accept her parents and brother as they are. This is evidenced by the

following additional scenes.



* Lisa notices Bart's classmates cheering him and makes some remark that you'll

never fail by appealing to the lowest common denominator. Mr. Bergstrom

then, as well as assuring Lisa that she will one day be successful warns her

that she will miss her brother.



* In my favorite scene in the laundry room, Lisa gushes about her crush on Mr.

Bergstrom. She then tries to tell Marge that her love for Mr. Bergstrom is

"different" (=> more real) than Marge's love for Homer. Marge finally snaps

at Lisa and tells her that if she expects Marge to understand her crush, she

is going to have to accept the fact that Marge loves Homer.



* [re Homer's visit to Bart] Assuming that Bart, like MG, is not stupid, but

instead has an artistic bent Homer correctly surmised that Bart would not be

happy with the responsibilities that class presidency brings. His campaign

was somewhat of a joke anyway.



* [re Homer's visit to Maggie] If babies don't see something right in front of

them, they sometimes think the object is gone. Maggie finds the pacifier

necessary as she goes through teething. On top of all this the room was

dark, and she was probably groping for it. The simple act (to us) of this

restoration was a great relief to Maggie.



In short (cliche and pun aside), the little things DO mean a lot.



When Lisa plays her sax, notice that the baseball diamond is pointing away

from the school building. (A good idea.) Unfortunately, there is no backstop

and there is a tree in left-center field.



When Homer is in Lisa's room trying to cheer her up, Lisa's vanity has a

mirror with three photos taped to it (an elf, etc). In most of the scenes,

the photos eclipse Homer when he is seen in the mirror, but at one point,

Homer is eclipsing the photos, as if the photos are not on the mirror but

on the wall behind him.



Mary Claire Pugh (pug2@ellis.uchicago.edu) and Merlyn LeRoy (merlyn@digibd.com)

were the first to point this out.



The Springfield Museum of Natural History had burnt down in `Moaning

Lisa' [7[FG]06]. {cjb}



At 9:15am, while Lisa reads a book, her classmates are throwing things

around the classroom.



1: Did you hear about Miss Hoover?

She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.

2: Oh, I heard she fell down a well.

[Principal Skinner comes in with Miss Hoover, who is crying]

Lisa: My God, she's been dumped again...

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Miss Hoover: [shakily] Children, I won't be staying long.

I just came from the doctor, and I have lyme disease.

Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.

Ralph: What's lyme disease?

Pr. Skinner: I'll field that one. [goes to blackboard] Lyme disease

is spread by small parasites called `ticks'. [writes `TICKS'

on blackboard] When a diseased tick attaches itself to

you, it begins sucking your blood...

Miss Hoover: [not calmed] Oh...

Pr. Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infect your bloodstream, eventually

spreading to your spinal fluid and on into the brain.

Miss Hoover: The brain!? Oh, dear God...

Class: Wow!

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Until the substitute teacher arrives, Principal Skinner teaches the class.



[a scream is heard from the room above]

Skinner: Bart Simpson! I know it's you!

-- Principal Skinner fills in for Miss Hoover, ``Lisa's Substitute''



For Show-and-Tell, Bart shows a videotape, titled, `How kittens are born:

The UGLY story'.



Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in!

-- Bart shows a videotape of kittens being born, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Back downstairs, Principal Skinner teaches the class about the schwa.



Bergstrom: [enters the classroom, guns ablazin']

Skinner: Are you the substitute?

Bergstrom: Yessir, yes I aim.

Skinner: Are you insane?

-- Principal Skinner doesn't quite get Bergstrom's unorthodox teaching

technique, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom takes over and asks the class to find three things wrong

with his costume. Lisa raises her hand and lists them. Her third point

was that Mr. Bergstrom appears Jewish, but there were no Jewish cowboys.

Mr. Bergstrom rewards her with his hat, though he intended the third

point to be that he is wearing a digital watch.



And, for the record, there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen.

Big guys who were great shots and spent money freely.

-- Mr. Bergstrom's lesson on the American West, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom introduces himself and suggests ways the class could make

fun of his name. Ms. Krabappel begins the process of electing a class

president, and she endorses Martin, who gives his nomination speech.



Martin: As your president, I would demand a science-fiction library,

featuring an ABC of the over[something] genre. Asimov,

Bester, Clarke!

Student: What abouy Ray Bradbury?

Martin: [dismissing] I'm aware of his work...

[orating] Thank you, and... Keep watching the skies...

-- Martin's campaign speech for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



During the cookie break, Mr. Bergstrom sings `Home on the Range'

(with editorial commentary) to the class, and the kids pass to Lisa a

picture of `the singing dork'. Mr. Bergstrom catches Lisa with it. She

insists she didn't draw it, though that doesn't seem to bother him. The

kids then pass to her a picture of `the singing dorkette'.

Sherri and Terri nominate Bart to run against Martin, and Ms. Krabappel

sends Bart out of the room. Bart does the blowfish on the door window.

Downstairs, Mr. Bergstrom finishes reading <Charlotte's Web> to the class.

Later, he asks the students in turn to demonstrate their special talent.

When it's Lisa's turn, he asks about her saxophone, but she refuses to

play it. After school, Lisa eavesdrops on a conversation and sees

Mr. Bergstrom spurn Ms. Krabappel's advances. Lisa sighs admiringly.

Outside on the playground, Lisa plays her sax for Mr. Bergstrom,

who watches from the classroom window.

[End of Act One. Time: 6:52]

While helping Marge fold the laundry, Lisa gushes about her crush on

Mr. Bergstrom and has trouble believing that Marge feels the same way

about Homer. Homer and Bart make fun of the fact that Mr. Bergstrom

cried when he read the end of <Charlotte's Web>.

At school, Lisa's class is dismissed for lunch, and Mr. Bergstrom calls

Lisa aside.



Mr. Bergstrom: Lisa, your homework is always so neat.

How can I put this? Does your father help you with it.

Lisa: No. Homework's not my father's specialty.

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa is not very flattering in her description of Homer. Meanwhile,

the campaign for class president continues.



Martin: [campaign speech] In a sample taken in this very classroom,

a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos!

Bart: That's not enough! We demand MORE asbestos!

[leads the class in a chant of `MORE ASBESTOS']

-- Martin and Bart run for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



The campaign confrontation makes the front page of `The Daily Fourth Grader',

headlined, ``Bart to Martin: Eat my shorts!''



Homer: Wow! You made the front page!

Bart: Aw, Dad, it's just a popularity contest?

Homer: JUST a popularity contest?

Excuse me. What's more important than popularity?

-- Bart runs for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



I always knew you had personality.

The doctor said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better.

-- Homer is pleased that Bart's running for class president,

``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer inspires Bart to ``Go get 'im!'' The campaign continues...



He says there aren't any easy answers.

I say, he's not looking hard enough!

-- Bart's campaign speech against Martin, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Martin's Poster: A Vote for Bart is a Vote for Anarchy!

Bart's Poster: A Vote for Bart is a Vote for Anarchy! [scrawled]

-- The campaign for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer helps Bart make a campaign poster: ``Sex! Now that I've got your

attention, vote for Bart!'' And on the playground, Bart hold up one

of Martin's campaign flyers and wipes the seat of his pants with it.

Lisa and Mr. Bergstrom watch from the classroom window.



You'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator.

-- Lisa comments on Bart's campaign antics, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom tells Lisa that she'll miss her brother when she goes on to

better things. Lisa says she believes everything he says.

The class write get-well letters to Miss Hoover, and when class is

dismissed, Mr. Bergstrom mentions that the Springfield Museum of Natural

History is closing due to lack of interest, and urges that they go see it

while they can. At home...



Marge: Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow,

and I think you should take her.

Homer: Museum? Tomorrow? Oh, oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning

on... [thinks to himself] Sleeping? Eating a big sandwich? Watching

TV? Spending time with the boy! [speaks up] Spending time with the

boy! The boy needs attention, Marge.

Marge: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa, and I'm concerned about your

relationship with her.

Bart: Me too, Mom. I think you're drifting apart.

Homer: Shut up, boy.

Marge: Homer, please.

Homer: Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because...

[thinking to himself] You're trapped. If you were smarter, you

might think of something. But you're not, so you just might as

well... [speaks up] All right, all right, I'll take her.

[sotto voce] Lousy brain.

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer takes Lisa to the museum and sees the sign,

`Suggested donation: $4.50'.



Homer: Eh, what do you mean by `suggested donation'?

Clerk: Pay any amount you wish, sir.

Homer: And uh, what if I wish to pay ... zero?

Clerk: That is up to you.

Homer: Ooh, so it's up to me, is it?

Clerk: Yes.

Homer: I see. And you think that people are going to pay

you $4.50 even though they don't have to?

Just out of the goodness of their... [laughs]

Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady, you're gonna need it!

-- Homer sees the sign `Suggested donation: $4.50' at the museum entrance,

``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom coincidentally arrives, and he joins Homer and Lisa.

Mr. Bergstrom lectures on dinosaurs and mummification...



Ooh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than the Wolf Man.

-- Homer admires the mummy at the museum, ``Lisa's Substitute''



While Homer admires, Lisa leaves with Mr. Bergstrom.

At the museum snack bar, while Lisa entertains herself with a static

electricity demonstration, Mr. Bergstrom tells Homer that Lisa needs

a strong male role model.



She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education,

youthful looks, and a clean credit record, and thinks, ``Why me? What

did I do to deserve this fat old piece of...'' [cries]

-- Homer talks to Mr. Bergstrom on Lisa's need for a strong male role model,

``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. B: There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.

Homer: Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A!

Mr. B: I <am> giving her an A.

Homer: Great, but don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.

Mr. B: Mr. Simpson, she <did> earn it.

Homer: You are smooth, I'll give you that.

-- On Lisa's education, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer joins Lisa at the static electricity exhibit.

At home, Lisa tells Marge that Homer ruined her one chance to get to

know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.



Marge: Why don't we invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?

Lisa: Oh, Mom! That's wonderful!

Can I find out his favorite dish and help you make it?

Marge: Sure.

Lisa: Can I wear your jewelry?

Marge: Sure.

Lisa: Can I get my ears pierced?

Marge: No.

Lisa: Can I dye my shoes pink?

Marge: Yes.

Lisa: Can I paint my nails?

Marge: No.

Lisa: Can we have wine?

Marge: Yes.

Lisa: Can I have wine?

Marge: No.

Lisa: Does Bart have to be there?

Marge: Yes.

Lisa: Can we do it this week?

-- Setting the ground rules, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Outside the classroom door, Lisa rehearses inviting Mr. Bergstrom to dinner.

But when she comes in, she sees Miss Hoover erasing Mr. Bergstrom's name

from the blackboard... ``Good morning, Lisa. I'm back.''

[End of Act Two. Time: 13:22]



Miss Hoover: You see, class, my lyme disease turned out to be

[spells it on the board] psychosomatic.

Ralph: Does that mean you're crazy?

Student 2: No, that means she was faking it.

Miss Hoover: No, actually, it was a little of both.

-- Miss Hoover returns to teaching, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Miss Hoover is miffed that Mr. Bergstrom didn't touch her lesson plan

and asks what he taught the class. Lisa says, ``That life is worth

living,'' and rushes out of the classroom in tears. Ms. Krabappel

announces that the polls will be open until the end of recess. The

candidates are invited to make their final statements. Martin is too

shaky to say much of anything. Bart announces, ``Victory party under

the slide!''

Lisa arrives at Mr. Bergstrom's apartment, but he moved out, having

gotten an assignment in Capital City.

At recess, Bart hands out cupcakes, but learns that nobody actually

voted. Not even Milhouse or Lewis. When the bell rings, Bart realizes

that <he> forgot to vote.

In the classroom, Martin and Wendell jump for joy.



Bart: I demand a recount!

Ms. K: [counts the votes] One for Martin. Two for Martin.

Would you like another recount?

Bart: [realizing he's beat] No.

Ms. K: [enjoying it] Well, I just want to make sure.

One for Martin. Two for Martin. [chuckles]

-- The Apathy Party loses again, ``Lisa's Substitute''



At the train station, Lisa catches Mr. Bergstrom as he's about to board

the train to Capital City. Lisa begs him not to leave.



That's the problem with being middle-class.

Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.

-- Mr. Bergstrom's parting remarks, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa tearfully understands. He tells her, ``Whenever you feel that you're

alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know,''

and hands her a note. Lisa chases the train as it pulls away, then looks

at the note. It reads, ``You are Lisa Simpson.''

At the dinner table ...



Bart didn't get one vote?

Oh, this is the worst thing that could ever happen to us!

-- Homer, on Bart failing to be elected class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa is upset about Mr. Bergstrom's leaving.



Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand!

-- Homer tries to understand Lisa, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa finally snaps...



Lisa: You, sir, are a baboon!

Homer: [gasp] Me?

Lisa: Yes, you! Baboon! Baboon! Baboon! Baboon!

Homer: I don't think you realize what you're saying...

Lisa: BABOON! [leaves in tears]

Bart: Whoa. Somebody was bound to say it someday, I just can't believe

it was her.

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Marge tells Homer to talk to Lisa. Ignoring the `Go Away' sign on her door,

Homer tries to cheer Lisa up, with no success. He makes a `monkey' joke and

dances around the room like a gorilla. This works. Homer goes to Bart,

who is upset at having lost the election. But Homer points out that the

class president has to do extra work and doesn't get to do anything neat.

This works. He then goes to Maggie's room and giver her her pacifier.

He comes downstairs to the kitchen, and stops Marge from talking.

``Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.''

... Maggie was eating the `lemur' flashcard?

... Burns and Bart have the (nonexistent) blood type `Double O negative'?

(And how could Smithers have donated that kidney if he's the wrong

blood type?)

... there was a green rat on the conveyor belt along with the rocks and

stuff? [Ray Charbonneau]

... Bart says `D'oh!' when trapped into giving blood?

... Homer gets everything wrong about the story of Androcles and the lion?

(It's not a Bible story, the hero is not Hercules, and he has the

plot COMPLETELY wrong!)

... the licence plate on the bloodmobile was `PLASMA1'?

And the tire flaps had a girlie picture on it?

... Otto was humming `Iron Man' by Black Sabbath when he was wiping

his hands with the handi-wipe? [Paul Naas]

And he got the handi-wipe out of a bucket of Shakespeare's

Friend Chicken?

... the blood goes `slurp' as the last few drops are transfused?

... when Burns recovers and visits his employees, there's

a sign that says `Sector 7-G'? [Brian Scearce]

... when Homer yells, ``Jackpot!'' upon seeing Mr. Burns alive,

he pulls his hand out of the debris sorter, and we see

a bright flash and hear a crashing sound?

... the Triceratops head on the wall in Burns' office?

[Philip J. Flores (am110@cleveland.Freenet.Edu)]

I guess Burns is older than we thought.

... Bart writes with his left hand? And he stuck his tongue out of

the corner of his mouth? (Just like Charlie Brown does...)

... Marge does `the hand thing', which we saw first in ``Simpsons

Roasting on an Open Fire'' [7[FG]08]?

... for breakfast, Homer was eating pancakes, which is what he dreamed

about?

... Barney was carrying a Crate-O-Duff? (Buildings near the mailbox

were `Springfield Hardware', and a building whose sign

read, `Apartments'.)

... Burns uses Smither's back as a table to sign Homer's pink slip?

... Burns was writing with a quill pen?

... how the outside weather mirrored Mr. Burns' mood? (The thunder

and lightning, then the storm clears up.)

... the Flanderses (Mom, Todd, and Rod) were on the escalator in front

of Mr. Burns and Smithers at the mall? [Jym Dyer]

... Burns' nose mushed up against the store window?

... Santa's Little Helper was, er, marking his territory on the

moving crate? [Jon Sterling Lindberg]

... we never see how they got the huge Olmec head through the tiny

front door?

... when Bart opened the crate, the falling sides broke a lamp?

... Snowball II was all over everything, including the Cool Olmec Head?

[Jym Dyer]

... at the very very end, the oil spot is back in the driveway?

... Maggie's food dish was empty? (Since when did babies ever

eat everything in their dish? Maybe she dumped it on the floor.)



And what was it that fell out of the corn starch can?



Dave Hall {dh}:

... Smithers doesn't knock, but barges in on MB's bedroom?

... The birds perched on the cooling towers?

... in Homer's dream, a safe fell out of MB's jacket?

... the suit of armor (complete with codpiece) in MB's home?



That seems to be an a lot of blood to be taken out of a 10 year old.

Why did Homer wait until nightfall to open his mail?



[me] Homer's attempt to tell the story of Androcles and the Lion.



[Tom Almy] When they were trying to decide what the moral of the story was,

as though they realized that they were at the end of the program. Sort of a

Gary Shandling type of thing.



[Anneliese D. Heiner (adh@po.CWRU.Edu)] Smithers playing the banjo in the

Sweet Home Alabama store. The expression on his face was hysterical!



[Bob Hogue (FC084801@ysub.ysu.edu)] Smithers' banjo playing was a scream

also. So out of character for Smithers. My second favorite scene was Lisa

teaching Maggie about a dodecahedron. What a child.



[Craig Stacey (craigs@garfield.cs.mun.ca)] Homer's visit to the post office.



Catherine C. Huse (kender@eleazar.dartmouth.edu) observes:



Smithers was JAMMIN'! and on the `Simpsons Sing the Blues' album, on

Mr. Burns' number (one of the best on the album, IMHO) `Look at All Those

Idiots', Smithers plays a rocking `impromtu' guitar solo and can hardly be

stopped even by Burns! Smithers is obviously a great guitar player.



The sign on the podium reads, ``Mayor `Diamond' Joe Quimby'', so I guess

this establishes that ol' DJ is the town mayor.

Homer: Marge! What's my blood type?

Marge: B Positive.

Homer: Aw, nuts, extremely rare blood and I don't have it...

Lisa: You know his blood type? How romantic!

Marge: A mother knows everything about her family.

Lisa: Oh yeah? What's my shoe size?

Marge: 4B.

Bart: How many teeth do I have?

Marge: 16 permanent, 8 baby.

Homer: Earmuffs.

Marge: XL.

Lisa: Rings?

Marge: I don't want you wearing rings. It looks cheap. But three.

Bart: Allergies.

Marge: Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.

Bart: And...?

Marge: Glow-in-the-dark monster make-up.

Bart: Ooh, impressive.

Homer: [covers Marge's eyes] How many hairs on my head, without looking.

Marge: Oh, you've got lots of hair.



bunch of the insults that Homer mailed him. After the sarcastic part of

the letter, Homer writes, ``You stink! You are a senile, buck-toothed old

mummy with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!'' When

Burns is storming around his study, he shouts, ``Senile, eh? Buck-toothed,

am I? Bony arms, are they? Liver spots, did I? Chinless, will you?'' No

doubt Burns has had similar letters sent to him in the past, and he's

confused some of them.



When Homer grouses over Burns' letter, observe that the kitchen cabinet door

is conspicuously open. The reason for that is so that Homer can slam it shut.



Theron Stanford notes that when Homer checks his watch, it reads `7:02A', yet

when he leaves the office, the clock over the door reads five minutes to 3.

[Or a quarter past ten. Hard to tell which hand is smaller. --rjc]

When the nurse mounts the packet of Bart's blood (appropriately labelled,

``HUMAN BLOOD'') on the stand, it is about four-fifths full. When Smithers

says, ``Go ahead'', the packet is completely full. Then it drains as the

blood transfusion progresses.

Brian Scearce observes that when Smithers is giving Larry his instructions

on beating Homer, his (Smithers') suspenders vanish from the front of his

body when he bawls, ``He saved Mr. Burns' life!''

When Smithers shakes hands with Mr. Burns, he is clean-shaven.

Monty Burns' commentary is parenthesized, my comments are bracketed, and Dave

Hall's {dh} are just plain included without embellishment.



The Brushes Are Coming, The Brushes Are Coming

(Ooh, too practical.) [I guess Burns forgot Homer's hair condition.]

The Jam O'Shanter Collection

(Too cutesy-poo.)

Jimbo is in the shop and Smithers' thumb and finger are bandaged.

Sweet Home Alabama, ``The store with things from Alabama''

(Too corn-ball.)

Wicked Excess

(A pool table? I'm not going to turn his home into a saloon!)

Smithers sinks only one ball---the cue ball.

Plunderer Pete's

(Eureka! We've found it!)

The large safe from the HMS Titanic is among the artifacts.

* [7[FG]10] The fe-mail-carrier.



Mayor `Diamond' Joe Quimby inaugurates the new Nuclear Disaster Warning Sign

which contains the caption `Nuclear Plant Conditions' atop an electronic

billboard.



Diamond Joe Quimby: Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests,

I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the

off-chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the

good citizens of Springfield, what to do!

[sign lights up, ``Relax. Everything is fine.'']

Crowd: Aah. [applause]

[sign lights up, ``Minor leak. Roll up window.'']

Crowd: Ooh. [mild applause]

[sign lights up, ``Meltdown. Flee city.'']

Crowd: [scattered applause]

[sign lights up, ``Core explosion. Repent sins.'']

Crowd: [stunned silence]

Homer: Hee hee. Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any

power to light that sign!

-- Homer jokes with his coworkers about the Nuclear Disaster Warning Sign,

``Blood Feud''



But Burns isn't present. Smithers finds Burns flat on his back.



No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me. As long as there's

an ounce of strength left in me, I... [passes out]

-- Monty Burns collapses from hypohemia, ``Blood Feud''



Dr. Hibert diagnoses Burns with hypohemia. Smithers offers his own blood,

but he's the wrong blood type.



Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me

really hit the spot.

-- Burns, consoling Smithers, who is unable to give the blood necessary

to save his life, ``Blood Feud''



When Smithers announces Burns' situation over the company PA system, nobody

wants to help, and Homer scolds them.



I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions

of dollars who needs our help. And you don't want to cash in?

-- Homer tries to take the moral high ground when none of his coworkers

wants to donate blood to save Mr. Burns, ``Blood Feud''



At home, Lisa shows Maggie flashcards with exotic animals like the lemur

and zebu.



[showing Maggie flashcards] Maggie, look! What's that? Lemur.

[slowly] Le-mur. [next card] Zebu. [slowly] Ze-bu.

-- Lisa tries to enlighten Maggie, ``Blood Feud''



Marge: [watching Lisa show Maggie flashcards] What's a zebu?

Lisa: It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap.

[indicating to Maggie] [sweetly] Hump, and a dewlap! Hump and dewlap!

-- Lisa shows Maggie animal flashcards, ``Blood Feud''



Homer comes in and asks Marge what his blood type is. Marge impresses the

family with her knowledge of everything about them, and mentions that Bart

has the rare double O negative that Mr. Burns needs. Bart refuses to give

his blood, but Marge tells him it's the right thing to do. And Homer tells

Bart he'll be showered with gifts if he does...



Homer: Don't you know the story of Hercules and the lion?

Bart: Is it a Bible story?

Homer: Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time, there was a big mean lion

who got a thorn in his paw. All the village people tried to pull it

out, but nobody was strong enough! So, they got Hercules. And

Hercules used his mighty strength, and Bingo! Anyway, the moral is,

the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big... thing... of riches.

Bart: How did a lion get rich?

Homer: It was the olden days!

Bart: Oh.

-- ``Blood Feud''



The next day, Homer takes Bart to the Bloodmobile to donate the blood.

The blood is rushed to the hospital, sort of. As the blood transfusion

is made...



Burns: [weakly] Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to

dictate my epitaph.

Smithers: [choked with tears] Go ahead.

Burns: Charles Montgomery Burns. ... American... Patriot... American...

Patriot... [gaining energy] Master of the atom. ... Scourge

of the despot! [really on a roll] Oh, tyrant! Hear his

mighty name, and quake! [gets up] Smithers, I'm back!

-- Burns receives a badly-needed transfusion, ``Blood Feud''



Burns arrives at work, bright and cheery.



Burns: Oh, top of the morning to ye! Why, look who's here!

It's ... good old... You!

Man: Hi, Mr. Burns.

Burns: Oh, hey there, Mr. uh... Brown-Shoes! How about that ..

local sports team!

-- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''



Burns also beats his opponent at jai alai.



Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!

-- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''



You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and

tonic and patent medicine there is, and all I really needed was the blood

of a young boy.

-- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''



Burns: By the way, what was the lad's name?

Smithers: Uh, Bart Simpson, sir.

Burns: Who?

Smithers: He's the son of Homer Simpson, sir. One of your stiffs

in sector 7-G.

-- Burns leans who donated the blood to save his life, `Blood Feud''



Burns says Bart will be receiving a surprise in the mail. At home...



Bill. [tosses into wastebasket]

Bill. [tosses into wastebasket]

Summons. [tosses into wastebasket]

Bill. [tosses into wastebasket]

-- Homer goes through the daily mail, ``Blood Feud''



He then finds a letter from Burns.



Homer: Marge, Lisa, Maggie, let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors

can see. Lisa, dim the lights. No, turn on more lights. Oh, do

something!

Lisa: Yes, Dad. [turns on the sprinkler]

-- Homer prepares to open the letter from Mr. Burns, ``Blood Feud''



But it's just a card that reads, ``Dear Bart, thank you kindly for the

blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns.'' Lisa turns off the sprinkler.



Some way to show your gratitude! No gold, no diamonds, no rubies, not even

a lousy card! Wait a minute... there <was> a card...

-- Homer is mad at Mr. Burns, whose only expression of gratitude was a

thank-you card, ``Blood Feud''



Marge: Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do

them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.

Homer: Marge, you're my wife, I love you very much, but [condescendingly]

you're living in a world of make-believe! With flowers and bells

and leprechauns and magic frogs with funny little hats.

Bart: Yeah, Mom, we got hosed.

-- When Bart saves Mr. Burns' life with his donated blood, ``Blood Feud''



But Homer is mad because he promised Bart lots of riches.



Homer: Bart! Take a letter!

Dear Mr. Burns... [heavy sarcasm] I'm so `glad' you enjoyed my

son's blood. And your `card' was `just great'. In case you can't

tell, I'm being sarcastic. You.. Stink! Could you read that last

part back to me?

Bart: `You stink!'

Homer: Heh heh heh. Good. `You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy,

with bony girl-arms, and you smell like...'

Bart: An elephant's butt?

Homer: Hee hee. `An elephant's butt.'

-- Homer writes a nasty letter to his boss, ``Blood Feud''



Homer is about to mail the letter, but Marge convinces him to sleep on it.

Homer's dream defies description. The next morning, Homer thanks Marge

for stopping him. We see Bart walking down to the corner mailbox and

putting the letter in.

[End of Act 1. Time: 9:35]

Homer turns the house upside-down to find the letter, then learns Bart

mailed the letter. Homer attacks Bart, but Marge scolds him. ``You

should be strangling yourself.'' Homer and Bart try to retrieve the

letter from the mailbox, with no success.



I'm with you, Homer! Fight the Power!

-- Barney provides encouragement as Homer kicks the mailbox, ``Blood Feud''



Homer: I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will

be able to read it!

Bart: Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?

Homer: So a few people won't get a few letters, boo hoo!

You know the kind of letters people write. ``Dear somebody you've

never heard of, How is so-and-so? Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

Yours truly, some bozo.'' Big loss.

-- On watering the mail to prevent a letter from being mailed, ``Blood Feud''



Before Homer can execute his plan, he's caught.



Homer: I guess it wouldn't do any good to run 'cause you're a mail-lady and you

know my name and address and everything, huh?

Postal Worker: That's right.

Homer: Well.. I'm still going to run. [runs away]

-- Homer is caught tampering with a mailbox, ``Blood Feud''



Meanwhile, Burns hires a ghost writer to help him write his story of his

hypohemia incident.



Mr. Roman: First question. Have you slept with anyone famous?

Burns: Well, Countess von Zeppelin and I... [catches himself] What in blazes!

-- Burns hires a ghost writer, ``Blood Feud''



Burns decides to write it himself. Homer goes to the post office pretending

to be Mr. Burns...



Homer: [trying to disguise his voice]

Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.

Postal Clerk: Okay, Mr. Burns, uh, what's your first name?

Homer: [brief pause] I don't know.

[outside on the steps of the post office] Great plan, Bart.

-- Trying to intercept a letter, ``Blood Feud''



Back at the house...



Lisa: Ooh, look, Maggie! What is that? Dodecahedron! Dodecahedron!

Homer: Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange, and

your father is trying to worry.

-- Lisa shows Maggie some very peculiar flashcards, ``Blood Feud''



Burns continues writing his book as Homer sneaks into Burns' office

to steal the letter. Burns finds him...



Burns: Who are you?

Homer: [thinks] Don't tell him. Give him a fake name.

[aloud] Homer Simpson.

[thinks] D'oh!

-- Thinking fast on your feet, ``Blood Feud''



... and opens the letter. Homer is taken away.



I could crush him like an ant. But it would be too easy. No, revenge is

a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell.

I'll just crush him like an ant.

-- Burns plans his next move, ``Blood Feud''



[End of Act 2. Time: 14:09]

Burns tells Smithers to have Homer beaten to a pulp. Back at home,

Homer bemoans his fate.



Bart: You always told me I was going to destroy the family. But I never

believed it.

Lisa: That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it.

We were just trying to scare you.

-- Bart destroys the family, ``Blood Feud''



An unshaven Smithers tries to tell Joe to beat up Homer, but can't do it.

Meanwhile, Burns finishes up his book...



In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you.

`What's that?' you say? Me thanking you?

No, it's not a misprint, for you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much

as you enjoyed reading it. The End.

-- Burns finishes his book, ``Blood Feud''



Smithers comes in and says he didn't order the beating, since after all,

Homer saved his life. Burns is won over. At Moe's Tavern, Homer

drowns his sorrows in drink.



Moe: [answers the phone] Moe's Tavern, where the elite meet to drink.

Bart: Uh, hello. Is Mike there? Last name, Rotch.

Moe: Hold on, I'll check. [calls] Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch! Hey, has

anybody seen Mike Rotch lately? [snickers from the patrons]

[to phone] Listen, you little puke. One of these days, I'm going

to catch you, and I'm going to carve my name on your back with

an ice pick.

-- Another phone prank, ``Blood Feud''



Moe: What's the matter, Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.

Homer: I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.

Moe: Homer, hey. You should not drink to forget your problems.

Barney: Yeah. You should only drink to enhance your social skills. [belch]

-- But does it work? ``Blood Feud''



Burns decides...



We'll get the Simpsons a present. An extravagant present. A mad, unthinkable,

utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!

-- Monty Burns meets Dr. Seuss? ``Blood Feud''



After much searching, he finds it, for $32,000. A huge crate is delivered to

the Simpsons residence, and Burns gives Homer an advance copy of his

book, ``Will There Ever Be a Rainbow?''



Burns: Hello, young fellow. I haven't forgotten you. Here.

Bart: Wow, a crowbar!

Lisa: It's to open the crate, stupid.

-- Burns gives the Simpsons a gift, ``Blood Feud''



It's a 3000-year-old carved head of Xtapolapocetl [I definitely spelled

it wrong, but I can't find it in my dictionary].



Maggie: [holds up an `Aztec' flashcard]

Lisa: No, Maggie. Not Aztec, Olmec. [slowly] Ol-mec.

Maggie: [falls down]

-- Lisa tries to enlighten Maggie, ``Blood Feud''



Burns leaves. The family eat dinner on TV dinner trays, watching the

giant head do nothing.



Homer: Save a guy's life, and what do you get? Nothing! Worse than nothing!

Just a big scary rock.

Bart: Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head.

Marge: Homer, it's the thought that counts. The moral of the story is a

good deed is its own reward.

Bart: Hey, we <got> a reward. The head is cool.

Marge: Then... I guess the moral is no good deed goes unrewarded.

Homer: Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't've

gotten anything.

Marge: Well... Then I guess the moral is the squeaky wheel gets the grease.

Lisa: Perhaps there is no moral to this story.

Homer: Exactly! Just a bunch of stuff that happened.

Marge: But it certainly was a memorable few days.

Homer: Amen to that!

[laughter all around]

-- We don't need no steenkin' morals, ``Blood Feud''

Three Men and a Comic Book Written by Jeff Martin

Directed by Wes M. Archer

Less-than-expected pay for work for a neighbor (Cloris Leachman) forces Bart

to go partners with Milhouse and Martin on a rare comic book, but who will

keep the treasure?



Special Guest Voice

Cloris Leachman (Mrs. Quick)



... the signs that went past while Bart and Lisa were riding

to the comic convention? [I sure didn't.]

... the kid at the comic convention dressed as Krusty?

[mandorallen@st1.vuw.ac.nz]

... the Itchy and Scratchy poster at the convention?

... Buddy `Fallout Boy' Hodges smokes?

... the goofy face Bart makes when he says `fine'?

``You really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a <fine> restaurant

like Krusty Burgers?''

... Maggie smashing french fries into the table?

... young Marge was wearing a Lisa-dress?

... Milhouse sleeps with his glasses on?

... Marge's custom hood on her jacket?

... the crooked cops not only accepted Bart's bribe, but they

also littered the street with the empty beer cups? [Not

to mention drinking on the job.]

... when Marge serves the boys milk and s'mores, it sounds like they're

eating rocks! (I.e., not the satisfying `crunch' followed by `munch

munch' but rather the sound of, well, rocks being eaten.)



... the surly Krusty Burger employee at the counter? (complete

with cigarette and ketchup-stained uniform.) [Gianni Schicchi]



... Patty and Selma didn't have raspy voices until they started

smoking? [Chuck Mosher]



and perhaps the single most important DYN of the entire episode...



... Radioactive Man had FIVE (count 'em!) fingers after the atomic

bomb exploded! {cjb}



Truly inspired moments:



The Wonder Years voice-over. Yes, that was Daniel Stern's voice.



At the very end when it looks as if we're going to have a moral

sledgehammered into us, we get a nice twist.



The title is probably a pun on `Three Men and a Baby', though

Tom Owen suggests it might come from the more obscure series of

books titled `Three Men and a ...' by Jerome K. Jerome.

+ Treasure of the Sierra Madre

- Paranoia over a jointly-held valuable.

- `Nobody makes a sap out of...' {to}

- `Simpsons Illustrated' said so.

~ Batman

- Bart [Michael Keaton] grabs the comic book guy [criminal] and

says, ``I'm Bartman [Batman].'' Same shot, same inflection. {sf}

Gone with the Wind (the amputation scene)

- Bart's silhouetted agony when the iodine is applied. {kl}

calls him `Piggy' and threatens to stuff an apple in his mouth. {jt}

Dave Hall {dh}:



Marge's apron is drawn rather badly. From the front, you see where the

apron clearly tied and the two straps go over her shoulders, but from the

back, the straps are gone. [And since when did apron have shoulder straps?

It's not a dress; it's an apron! --rjc]



sep00@outs.ccc.amdahl.com (Stephan E J Papa):



1) Ability to make whishing noise when moving into camera view.



2) Ability to change into always carried super-costume in a phone booth.



For non-American viewers

The program `Wonder Years' consists of the reminiscences of a now-adult

Kevin Arnold, who looks back on his childhood (circa 1970) and provides

voice-over narration of the action.



In the program, Kevin's narration is never interrupted because the adult

Kevin is telling the story in retrospect, and therefore can insert pauses

in the action wherever he wants.



Bart's version of the Wonder Years

David Tamkin explains:



What was really out of place for Bart's retrospectives is that an adult Bart

cannot yet exist, or it would violate the time line established in "The Way

We Was," "Principal Charming," "Bart Gets an F," "Three Men and a Comic

Book," "Moaning Lisa," "Some Enchanted Evening," and other episodes that have

given us ages or dates. We have to view it as a flash-forward in Bart's mind

(like the one in "Bart Gets an F"); Bart zones out into thinking about how

he'll look back on these events when he reaches adulthood, but unlike the

narrations of a grown-up Kevin Arnold, who can hit the pause button on his

memories of childhood whenever he pleases, Bart <is> in his childhood and

cannot violate his childhood's timing. Thus, his fantasy flash-forwards are

interruptible by the real events of his childhood but Kevin's retrospective

narrations are interruptible only by the real events of Kevin's adulthood,

but not by those of his adolescence, which are fitted around the narration.



Corby Page notes that `best 3 out of 5' doesn't make sense when there are

three players.



Andrew Tannenbaum (trb@ima.isc.com) notes:



I thought the writers intentionally goofed to add to the cathartic

irony of the scene, since the methods got successively more ridiculous.

They could have chosen to rotate Sundays, then they could have chosen

to reroll on zero, then they could have chosen a simpler game than Rock,

Scissors, Paper for three people. Only when the method got silly

enough, did the three of them agree to it.



the good times roll!'' was spoken so that the word `times' came out like

`dimes'. Pun? Happy coincidence? You make the call.



What are imitation marshmallows? Marshmallows are already one of the most

artificial foods on the face of the earth!



mandorallen@st1.vuw.ac.nz asks...



... why was it that Marge got her gravel voice from birth, while

Patty and Selma only developed it through smoking?

... any speculation on the _special_ relationship that seems to have

existed between Dirk "Radioactive Man" Richter and Buddy "Fallout

Boy" Hodges?

Marge chauffeurs Lisa and Bart en route to the Springfield Comics

convention...



Lisa: If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will

be gone!

Bart: Ah, what do you care about good comics? All you every buy is Casper

the Wimpy Ghost.

Lisa: I think it's sad that you equate friendliness with wimpiness, and

I hope it'll keep you from ever achieving true popularity.

Bart: Well, you know what I think? I think Casper is the ghost of

Richie Rich. [shows comics of Casper and Richie Rich]

Lisa: Hey, they do look alike!

Bart: Wonder how Richie died.

Lisa: Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money really is and

took his own life.

Marge: Kids, could you lighten up a little?

-- driving to the comics convention, ``Three Men and Comic Book''



At the convention, Bart and Lisa stand in line for tickets, and discover

that visitors who come dressed as comic-book stars are entitled to a

discount.



Too bad you didn't come dressed as a popular cartoon character.

-- Lisa to Bart at the comics convention, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''

[a little meta-humor for your enjoyment]



So Bart ducks into a phone booth and emerges as BartMan. But it doesn't

get him a discount. Diamond Joe Quimby delivers the opening address for the

convention. Martin goes to the lost-and-found table in search of a left

Vulcan ear. At a table where prospective artists have the opportunity

to show their work to an industry professional, Bart happens upon Otto.



Bart: Oooh, what's that?

Otto: My very own idea for a comic book, little man.

[unveils his conception of Busman, which bears a distinct resemblance

to Otto despite some anatomically awesome features]

It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night,

fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic war zone!

Bart: Cool!

-- A Heroic Ideal, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart attends a film exhibition of one of the early Radioactive Man

episodes.



Radioactive Man: Ah, these Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves that

I need to combat evil.

Fallout Boy: Gee willikers, Radioactive Man. Wished I was old enough to

smoke Laramies.

Radioactive Man: Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen.

-- ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



The convention's celebrity guest is none other than Buddy `Fallout Boy'

Hodges himself, who fields questions from the inquisitive youngsters.



Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his

bullet-riddled body was found?

-- Bart asks a pointed question at a Q&A session at the comic convention,

``Three Men and a Comic Book''



After the seminar, Bart checks out a dealer's display table. The dealer

shows Bart his most prized possession...



Bart: Wow, Radioactive Man #1! I bet it's worth a million bucks!

Dealer: It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for a hundred, because you

remind me of me.

-- A deal that's hard to beat, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know:

To buy that comic book!

-- Bart, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



but Bart has only $30. The convention ends, and the Shriners arrive to

use the center. Homer and Marge pick up the kids, who are pleased that

Homer is taking them to Krusty Burger for dinner. Then Bart asks...



Bart: I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.

Homer: A hundred bucks for a comic book? Who drew it, Michael Milangelo?

-- ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart: I want this more than anything in the world.

Homer: Well, T.S.!

-- Bart wants $100 to buy a comic book, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



At Krusty Burger...



Bart: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Bart: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Homer: No.

Bart: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Homer: No.

Bart: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Bart: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Bart: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Bart: Please, Dad.

Homer: No! Now look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like

this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. (It shows

you've been paying attention.) But we all know I'm not gonna give

you a hundred dollars. Now, are you going to stop bugging me?

Bart: No.

Homer: Are you?

Bart: No.

Homer: Are you?

Bart: No.

Homer: Are you?

Bart: No.

Homer: Are you?

Homer: Are you?

Bart: OKAY!!!!

Homer: Hoo hoo! I win! In your face! Yeah, how do you like them apples?

-- ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Marge tells Bart a story of how she earned money to buy a light bulb toy

oven.



Young Selma: We'll give you half our allowance.

Young Patty: Uh huh. But you have to be our slave.

Young Marge: Oh, okay.

Young Selma: This gives us a lot more free time.

Young Patty: Uh huh. Let's take up smoking.

-- Marge wants to buy a light-bulb toy oven, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



and concludes...



Marge: Maybe a part-time job is the answer.

Bart: Oh, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. Your already taking care

of Maggie and Lisa is such a handful.

Lisa: She means <you> should get a job, stupid!

-- Bart needs $100 to buy a comic book, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart: [Daniel Stern's voice, a la Wonder Years] Me? Get a job? Were they

serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my

childhood had slipped away, forever.

Homer: Bart! What are you staring at?

Bart: Uh, nothing. [Daniel Stern continues] He didn't say it, and neither

did I, but at that moment, my dad and I were closer than we...

Homer: Bart! Stop it!

Bart: Sorry.

-- ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



[End of Act One. Time: 7:04]

Bart embarks on a Quest for Cash.



Bart: Ching-ching-ching! [smashes a souvenir coin collection he received

from Patty and Selma] [goes to the bank] Americanize this, my good man.

Clerk: Okay.

Bart: All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?

Clerk: Let the good times roll!

-- Bart is desperate for money, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart empties a half-full coke bottle, and takes it to his local Kwik-E-Mart.



Bart: There you go, Apu.

Apu: Ah, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a

jumbo cherry squishy?

Bart: No, not today, I need the dime.

Apu: Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade.

-- Young entrepeneurship, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart sets up an outdoor beverage stand, but soon concludes that ``lemonade

sucks''. He manages to attract a significantly larger clientele when he

switches to beer as his product of choice.



Barney: Hey, Bart, can you give me one on credit? I'm a little short this

week.

Bart: Beat it.

-- No harm in trying, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Trouble approaches...



Cop: Hey, uh, do you have liquor license here, young fella?

Bart: Uh, my dog ate it.

-- Bart's one-time lemonade stand is now a beer stand,

``Three Men and a Comic Book''



... but Bart manages to buy off the cops with some free brew. Homer

arrives home and wails tearfully at the loss of his beer. At Jake's

Unisex Hair Palace, Marge talks about Bart's dilemma, and Mrs. Quick

offers to pay Bart to do chores at her house. Bart goes to Mrs. Quick's

house, where he gets an enthusiastic reception.



Dried apricots? Almond paste? Sauerkraut candy!

-- Mrs. Quick offers Bart some sweets, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart enquires about a soldier photo sitting on a desk, and Mrs. Quick

recounts the tale of her brother Asa who died in WW II after holding a

grenade too long.



[Asa pulls the pin, ready to throw the grenade]

-- And the rest is history, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Mrs. Quick sends Bart out to clear weeds from her jungle-like backyard, and

sits down to enjoy a smarmy soap.



Woman: Jack, please, I'm married.

Jack: [embraces her] Ha. Must be what's turning me on. [hot stuff ensues]

Mrs.Q: Filthy! But genuinely arousing.

-- Mrs. Quick watches a smarmy soap, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart comes in, scraped up by his arduous labor. Mrs. Quick applies iodine

directly to his cuts, with predictably painful results. At home, Bart

complains to Marge. The next day, he gets to clean sludge from Mrs. Quick's

drainage pipe. Afterward, Mrs. Quick shows Bart her remarkably versatile

wedding/funeral dress. Bart goes to the comic shop, where he gazes at

Radioactive Man #1 through the store window.



Last night, I dreamed I held you in my arms.

-- Bart, Romancing the Comic, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Later, Bart is scratched by Mrs. Quick's cat while scrubbing the floor. But

Mrs. Quick tends to Bart's injury with Tender Loving Care and a bottle of

iodine.



No, no, not the iodine. Burn the germs off with a torch.

Amputate my arm, but not the .... AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

-- Bart is treated by Mrs. Quick, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



At the end of the week, Bart receives the sum total of fifty cents.



Mrs. Quick: Bart! You didn't say `Thank you'.

Bart: Listen Lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can

leave without saying a bad word, but there is no way that I

am saying `Thank you'.

Mrs. Quick: You're welcome!

-- Bart is upset that he worked his tail off and got paid only fifty cents,

``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart comes home and mutters angrily.



Homer: Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.

Bart: Really?

Homer: Naah.

-- Bart is upset that he worked his tail off and got paid only fifty cents,

``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart: I am through with working. Working is for chumps.

Homer: Son, I'm proud of you. I was <twice> your age before I figured

that out.

-- Bart is upset that he worked his tail off and got paid only fifty cents,

``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart returns to the shop, and walks in on Martin trying to bargain for

Radioactive Man #1.



Martin: Can you let me have it for forty dollars?

Dealer: Forty bucks? You made me get off my stool for that?

Martin: It's all I got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home.

I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!

Dealer: No way. [notices Bart] What do you want?

Bart: Can I have it for thirty-five?

-- Unsuccessful haggling, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Milhouse enters in search of a baseball card, but Bart realizes that the

three of them together have enough money to buy the comic. Martin and

Milhouse consent to the joint purchase.



Bart: Look pal, we got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy

Radioactive Man #1. So why don't you just waddle over

there and get it?

Dealer: Yes, sir.

-- Bart in charge, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Outside the shop, the boys discover that each of them had intended to take

comic home. A storm broods over the skies of Springfield, evilly portending

the conflict that will soon arise between these three friends.

[End of Act Two. Time: 14:28]

In Bart's treehouse, Martin, Milhouse, and Bart carefully read their comic

and discover the secret origin of Radioactive Man.



Martin: I would've thought that being hit by an atomic bomb would've

killed him.

Bart: Now you know better.

-- The gang read the original `Radioactive Man' comic,

``Three Men and a Comic Book''



The boys negotiate the terms of their joint ownership.



Martin: How about this, guys? Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays,

Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays, and yours truly will

take it Wednesdays and Saturdays.

Bart: Perfect!

Milhouse: Wait a minute! What about Sundays?

Bart: [suspiciously] Yeah, what <about> Sundays?

Martin: Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number

generator. I will take the digits 1 through 3, Milhouse will

have 4 through 6, and Bart will have 7 through 9.

Bart: Perfect!

Milhouse: Wait a minute! What about 0?

Bart: [suspiciously] Yeah, what <about> 0?

Milhouse: Yeah.

Martin: Well, in the unlikely event of a 0, possession will be determined

by Rock Scissors Paper competition, best 3 out of 5. How's that?

Bart and: Oh, okay.

Milhouse: Yeah, all right.

-- An Equitable Split, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



But as the night progresses, tensions rise and suspicions breed.

A fight breaks out, but it is cut short when Marges comes by to visit.

Each suspecting the other two, all three spend the night in the treehouse

with the comic book. Later on in the evening, Martin gets up to go to

the bathroom, but Bart and Milhouse think he is attempting to steal the

comic. They bind him up in a chair. When Bart's paranoia increases to

dangerous levels, Milhouse threatens to tell Marge.



Bart: Hey, Martin, tell him what we do with squealers.

Martin: I don't know. Is it worse than what you do with people who have to go

to the bathroom?

-- Crime and Punishment, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Bart and Milhouse fight fiercely as the storm rages outside. Marge asks

Homer to check on the kids, but Homer doesn't do a very good job of it.

Milhouse tumbles out of the treehouse. Bart catches him by the sleeve,

which slowly begins to tear. Meanwhile, the wind blows the comic book

against the doorway, and it is on the verge of falling into the rain

outside. Faced with the decision of saving Milhouse or the comic, Bart

reluctantly chooses Milhouse. During the brief moment in which Bart

comforts the frightened Milhouse, the comic falls outside onto the

rain-drenched ground. Then Santa's Little Helper eats it. Then lightning

incinerates it. Marge summons the boys inside because the weather is so bad.



I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?

-- Marge, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



The next morning, Homer finds the car filled with water because he left

the windows open. In a beautiful little 3-D animation sequence, the boys

ponder over the lessons of the previous evening.



Bart: We worked so hard, and now it's all gone.

We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.

Milhouse: What's your point?

Bart: Nothing. Just kind of ticks me off.

-- The moral of the story, ``Three Men and a Comic Book''



Well, the world is safe again... But... for how long?

[End of Act Three. Time: 20:24]

After the 30-Apr-1992 airing, a brief Simpsons clip was shown.

Close-up of the Simpsons television. A picture of Bill Cosby, with

the legend, ``The Cosby Show / 1984-1992''. Muses Homer, ``Little

Theo. You grew up before our eyes.'' Bart asks, ``Hey, Dad. How

come they're taking The Cosby Show off the air?'' Homer answers,

``Because Mr. Cosby wanted to stop before the quality suffered.''



Quality, schmality! If I had a TV show, I'd run that sucker into the ground!

-- Bart learns of the demise of `The Cosby Show'



Homer pats Bart on the back. ``Amen, boy. Amen.''

... Marge wears lozenge-shaped earrings?

... Mrs. Flanders' name is Maude? And Mrs. Lovejoy's name is Helen?

... the car parked on the Simpsons front lawn at the party?

... Barney had zipped his fly up on his shirt tail? [Justin Masters]

He also did this in `Principal Charming'. {jpc}

... when Homer drunkenly tells off one of the guests, the hors

d'oeuvres platter still reads, ``Boy, our party sucks''.

(Apparently, Marge's cooking skills need honing.)

... Homer slept on the cat? (When he gets up the next morning, a

very frightened Snowball II scurries away.)

... the music Marge uses to drown out her argument with Homer is the

same music that the doctor used in `Simpson and Delilah' to drown

out his conversation with Homer?

... when Homer was explaining to Bart why he acted the way he did

the previous night, there is a model of the Road-Runner on Bart's

dressing table? {cjb}

... Marge's hat she wore in church, precariously balanced atop her

impressive coiffure?

... Maggie was tossing things into the shopping cart? (Compare 7[FG]13.)

... that Marge was losing her voice as she neared the end of her list

[Sanders Bayne (sanders.bayne@canrem.uucp) notes]



... Ned stuffs the whole bottle of alchohol into Homer's glass?

... Dr. Hibert's wife looks like Claire on the Cosby Show?

... Behind Rev. Lovejoy during the trust excercise, there was a picture of

a person who seemed lost?

... one of the baby twins in church had a bowl on her head during the party?



Dave Hall {dh}:

At the party...

... Possible Maggie fall-down: Maggie sort of hangs on to the edge of the

table, waves her little hand and either falls, or lets go.

... Ned was wearing a pink shirt and tie under his sweater? (That

free-thinking anarchist!)

... there was a car parked on the front lawn near the windows? (How did

it get there?)

... Rev. Lovejoy and his wife was at the party? Homer had the lampshade

on, jumps on top of the couch, fell over, spilling Rev. Lovejoy's

drink on himself. (Note that the spilt drink is actually an animation

goof as it was drawn in after Lovejoy dropped his glass.)

... when Marge throws the coats on the bed, there appears to be what looks

like a rather tall wig on top of the dresser?

... at the end of the party, Dr. Hibert actually helps his wife over Homer?



After the party...

... in Homer's flash back, his 2 strands of hair were styled back in the

form of a wave? Slick!

... in the babysitter's flashback, there's only a tiny spot of oil in the

driveway?

... when Homer & Marge drive away, Marge's head (including her hair) is

sticking out the car door window.

... the wide shot of the resort shows 5 cars parked? If there were three

couples and the Lovejoys, that would still leave one car not accounted

for. Did one of the couples drive to the retreat in different cars?

... when you see the three couples for the first time, each couple's

spouse is sitting apart?

... there appears to be a spot of oil under one of the school buses?

(As seen while Bart is talking to Auto.)

... according to the line marks, the Convict, with a rather large earring,

has been in prison for 30 days, or 2 1/2 years, depending on what

each line meant?

... the pay(?) phone outside the cell of the convict? (Kind of hard, if

not impossible, for him to make calls.)

Sanders Bayne observes that Homer rows back with both paddles in good condition

even though he broke one on General Sherman's head.



Dave Hall reports:



Before getting maced, Barny is holding his mug in his left hand.

Afterwards, the mug is shown in his right hand.



Bart, Lisa, & Maggie are looking out the window at the station-wagon.

This scene is somewhat impossible as the front bay windows are not

parallel to the driveway. Another "possible" goof is the station wagon

parked facing the street. The night before, Homer's car appears to be

the only car in the driveway. (But, there was a station-wagon parked on

the street.)



In the Baby Sitter's flash back, the movement of the position indicator

does not match the movement of the handle when "Baby Bart" puts the car in

drive.



Chris Baird notes:



When Maggie was trying to climb onto the table, the colour of the `Maggie

Baggie' was blue, but afterwards when the parents run out of the Dining

room in a panic, Maggie's overall has turned pink.

Dave Kessler, via Ben Morss (morss@husc.harvard.edu):



The part where Homer is imagining himself being very erudite and witty at

his party is straight out of something called `The Algonquin Round Table',

or something like that. It might also have had to do with Virginia Woolf.

He says that there is no question about it, that the reference was very

blatant.



billl@june.cs.washington.edu (William Longabaugh):



This scene has previously been called a reference to Abe Hirshfeld's

drawings, but I don't think that's right. Both times I've watched the

scene I also thought it was a reference to the Algonquin Round Table. I

don't know much about it, but it was part of the 1930-40's (?) social

scene in New York City; the Algonquin is a hotel near Times Square. I

stayed there once with my parents years ago and I remember drawings of the

Round Table in the lobby that looked just like the stuff in the Simpson's

scene. I think the drawings are pretty well-known, thus the reference in

the show. While the style is similar to Hirshfeld's, I think the Round

Table stuff predates him.



wab@worf.Rational.COM (Bill Baker):



The Algonquin round table was not a book or a movie; it was a famous group

of writers who used to meet at the Algonquin Hotel and exchange witty

repartee. Supposedly, most of those Dorothy Parker quotes people are

always attributing to other people were originally exchanged as bon mots at

the round table. I think maybe W.S. Merwin and Moss Hart were part of the

circle, but I'm not sure. At any rate, it was a very `New Yorker' clan,

and as is noted in the summary the cartoon style of that sequence is

reminiscent of Hirschfeld or `New Yorker' covers.



merlyn@digibd.com (Merlyn LeRoy):



No one had yet brought the Hirschfeld & Algonquin threads together yet,

so I will. Hirschfeld has <drawn> Algonquin get-togethers (he's older than

dirt); I remember one of Harpo playing golf on the table, with Dorothy

Parker, George S. Kaufmann, et al. He was probably considered a fringe

Algonquin.



Marge puts the finishing touches on the party preparations.



Mmm... Horse doovers...

-- Homer helps himself to the party snacks, ``War of the Simpsons''



Marge: [slaps Homer's hand] Homer! You promised.

Homer: I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!

-- Homer helps himself to the party snacks, ``War of the Simpsons''



Marge explains that they're throwing a party to pay back all the

friends who had invited them over.



Homer: Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all

the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?

Marge: That was our wedding!

Homer: Oh.

-- pre-party discussion, ``War of the Simpsons''



Marge sends the kids to bed, though Lisa wants to hear the witty banter

of sophisticated adults, and Bart complains, ``You can't have any

fun in bed.'' Homer chuckles, ``When you're older, you'll know better'',

and thinks of eating a hoagie in bed. The doorbell rings.



Marge: Oh, they're here. How does everything look?

Homer: Yeah, how do I look?

Marge: Do we have enough glasses?

Homer: Do we have enough gag ice cubes?

Marge: Homer, Homer, put a record on.

Homer: What are all our friends' names again?

-- pre-party panic, ``War of the Simpsons''



Ned, Maude, and Moe are the first guests.



And the house! You've done...

[looks at the living room; nothing spectacular] Whatever!

-- Ned tries to compliment the Simpsons, ``War of the Simpsons''



Ned mixes a drink...



Homer: Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it!

Ned: Au contraire, Simpson. It has three shots of rum, a jigger of

bourbon, and just a little daberilla of creme de cassis for flavor.

Homer: Really? Well, I do have a warm sense of well-being, and I sheem

to be slurring my speech. You're right! Gimme another.

-- Flanders demonstrates his mixological skills, ``War of the Simpsons''



Marge: Homer, go easy on the alkyhol. Remember last year at the Winfields'

party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?

Homer: No.

Marge: Mm.

-- Homer starts getting tipsy, ``War of the Simpsons''



The party is in full swing, sort of...



Hey! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right?

I remember you. But I don't remember you being so beau[burp]tiful.

[she maces him] Oh, ow, hey, [burp] [cough]

Is that a new kind of mace? It's really painful.

-- Barney talks to Patty (or is it Selma?), ``War of the Simpsons''



Dr. Hibert is not amused by Homer's gag ice cube. Bart swipes some

`horse doovers'', and Homer asks him to do ``that thing you know how

to do'' for the adults. Bart doesn't know what he's talking about,

so Homer sends him to bed. Later that evening, Homer makes a fool of

himself with a lampshade on his head. Meanwhile, Maggie gets into

the pile of coats and makes confetti of the dollar bills. Homer drunkenly

tells off a guest, and looks down Maude's dress. The guests leave...



Dr. Hibert: If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you

roll him onto his stomach.

Marge: Thank you, I will, Dr. Hibert. Thanks for coming.

Dr. Hibert: Remember, I said `if'.

-- The party's over, ``War of the Simpsons''

[And notice that she didn't roll him over! -- Chuck Anderson]



The next morning, Marge vacuums around Homer, and drags him into the car.



Bart: They're fighting in the car again.

Lisa: That music always sends a chill down my spine.

-- The kids watch Marge and Homer talk in the car, ``War of the Simpsons''



Marge asks Homer if he remembers how he acted at the party, and Homer's

recollection is most flattering to himself, then his memory kicks in,

and he realizes what really happened.



I like to think that I am a patient, tolerant woman, and that there

was no line you could cross that would make me stop loving you.

But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!

-- Marge, ``War of the Simpsons''



Marge says she's going to church alone.



Marge: You are going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred

him for life.

Homer: No, I didn't! I ... Oh, you mean inside, don't you.

-- ``War of the Simpsons''



Homer talks to Bart.



Homer: About last night. You might have noticed Daddy acting a little

strange and you probably don't understand why.

Bart: I understand why. You were wasted.

-- Damage control, ``War of the Simpsons''



Homer: I'm sorry it happened, and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect

for me.

Bart: Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.

Homer: Awww.... [pats Bart's head]

-- Damage control, ``War of the Simpsons''



In church...



We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack, including

`Bible Bafflers', `Satan's Boners', `Good Grief: More Satan's Boners'

and for the teens, `It's Not Cool to Fry in Hell'.

-- Rev. Lovejoy, ``War of the Simpsons''



Homer tries to sneak into church, but his squeaky shoes give him away.

Rev. Lovejoy invites all interested parties to his marriage retreat.

Marge signs up for it, despite Homer's attempts to stop her.

[End of Act One. Time: 7:00]

Homer learns the retreat is at Catfish Lake and plans to get some fishing

done, but Marge tells him there will be no fishing. The babysitter arrives

but recognizes Bart and screams in terror when she remembers how baby Bart

managed to start the car and drive it across the lawn.



Marge: Grampa, could you do something?

Grampa: I can dress myself.

-- Asking Grampa to babysit the kids, ``War of the Simpsons''



Grampa agrees to babysit the kids, and Homer secrets a tackle box in

the car trunk. Marge leaves the kids in Grampa's care. She hands

Grampa the list of emergency numbers, then goes to the kids and

hugs Bart (``Nga!''), Lisa (``Mmm...'') and Maggie (``suck, suck, suck'')

farewell. She pulls a slip of paper out of her hair. ``Call this number

if Grampa falls in the bathtub''. (``I heard that!'')



Bart: Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this.

It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do.

Grampa: [reads] Eh heh. Uh huh. You're allowed to smoke cigars?

-- Marge leaves the kids in Grampa's care, ``War of the Simpsons''



On the drive to Catfish Lake, Homer stops at a gas station/bait store

and learns about `General Sherman', the huge catfish that lives in the

lake. Homer announces that he will catch the General. Meanwhile,

Grampa drives the kids to the supermarket...



Bart: After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty

Burger, and head for the arcade.

Lisa: Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man. He trusts us. Are you sure it's

right to take advantage of him?

Bart: Lis, in these crazy topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or

wrong? But right now, my gut's telling me, ``Bleed Gramps dry.''

-- Grampa babysits the kids, ``War of the Simpsons''



The Simpsons arrive at the retreat and find the Flanderses also in

attendance.



A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer.

It takes a whole weekend to do that!

-- Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''



Rev.: We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way, a happy marriage,

heh heh, won't be the one that got away.

Homer: I see. [sotto voce] He also understands bowling expressions.

-- Rev. Lovejoy welcomes Homer to his marriage encounter retreat,

``War of the Simpsons''



Ah, three couples. Our best turnout yet!

-- Rev. Lovejoy opens the marriage counseling retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''



He asks the first couple, John and Gloria, to describe their problems,

and tells them to look into each others' eyes. They forgive each other

and leave to rekindle their relationship. Next is Ned's turn.



Ned: Sometimes Maude (God bless her), she underlines passages in <my> Bible

because she can't find hers.

Homer: [mutters] Oh. Lucky they don't keep guns in the house.

-- At Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''



Now it's Homer's turn to list Marge's faults...



Rev.: Marge is going to tell us about your faults, why don't you tell

us about hers?

Homer: Oh, she's perfect.

Rev.: Come on, Homer, what are her faults?

Homer: Well, sometimes it can be annoying.

-- At Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''



Then it's Marge's turn...



Marge: He chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy

bar with bums and lowlifes.

Homer: [covers his face] Oh, it's all true!

Rev.: Homer, don't interrupt.

Homer: Sorry.

-- At Rev. Lovejoy's marriage encounter retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''



Meanwhile, the kids go grocery shopping.



Lisa: Half a gallon of chocolate.

Bart: Check.

Lisa: Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.

Bart: Check.

Lisa: Half a gallon of chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate chip.

Bart: Yep.

Grampa: Did your mom really write that shopping list?

Lisa: Grampa, what a question!

-- Shopping for groceries, ``War of the Simpsons''



By 9:30pm, Marge has finished her list of Homer's faults.

The kids watch a McBane movie, then are sent to bed.



It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.

-- Lisa is concerned about how she and Bart are taking advantage of Grampa,

``War of the Simpsons''



Homer wakes up at 5am and plans `the perfect crime' to sneak out, catch

General Sherman, and return before Marge wakes up. He gets out of bed,

already in his fishing clothes, but Marge wakes up. She scolds him for

thinking about fishing when their marriage is at stake and tells him

to come back to bed. Homer asks if he can take a walk, and Marge agrees.

Outside, Homer sees a fisherman walking away from the pier. He grabs

the fishing rod and says, ``Hey kid, you forgot your... Whoaaaa!'' as

the fishing line is pulled away by General Sherman.

[End of Act Two. Time: 14:49]

Homer has landed in a boat and is waiting for General Sherman to tire

so he can reel him in. Marge hears Homer's screams. Back home...



Grampa: [pours Lisa a cup of coffee] Sugar?

Lisa: Yes, ten please.

Bart: [shaking] Hey Grampa, top me off.

Grampa: Are you sure your Ma let you kids drink coffee?

Bart: [snaps] For the last time, yes!

-- My breakfast with Grampa, ``War of the Simpsons''



Homer continues to struggle with the fish, and Bart invites everyone to

`Casa de Simpson' for a party. ``The only adult is frail and old.''

At the retreat...



Helen: Now, this is a trust exercise.

You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you.

Marge: Do I have to do this?

Rev.: No. Even if your husband <were> here, I wouldn't recommend it.

-- Marriage counseling retreat, ``War of the Simpsons''



Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where

I've ever told one partner that they were 100% right. It's all his fault.

I'm willing to put that on a certificate you can frame.

-- Rev. Lovejoy, ``War of the Simpsons''



Grampa emerges from the shower to find Bart's party well under way.

On the lake...



Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is.

Right up there with, the... uh... that bald guy on the cable fishing show.

-- Homer plans to catch `General Sherman', ``War of the Simpsons''



Holy mackerel!

-- Homer lands a catfish, ``War of the Simpsons''



At the party...



Otto: Any chicks over eight?

Bart: Not yet, but the afternoon is young.

-- Bart throws a wild party, ``War of the Simpsons''



Bart: Lisa, what's wrong?

Lisa: Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's

rights movement for decades to come.

Bart: You're great at a party, Lis. Really great.

-- Lisa observes the wild party Bart is throwing, ``War of the Simpsons''



Grampa tries to control the situation, with absolutely no success.

Homer finally subdues General Sherman. Bart wishes the partygoers

farewell, and Grampa cries on the couch.



Bart: Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before.

Lisa: It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepresible youth.

-- Is it contagious? ``War of the Simpsons''



To make it go away, ``You grab a bucket and a brush and you clean harder

and faster than you've ever cleaned before.'' Homer celebrates victory,

to find Marge waiting on the pier for him. Marge says the fish represents

how selfish he is, so Homer angrily tosses General Sherman back into the

lake.



I gave up fame and breakfast for our marriage.

-- Homer, after tossing `General Sherman' back into the lake,

``War of the Simpsons''



The two are reconciled. Bart and Lisa furiously clean up the house

just in time for Homer and Marge's return. Grampa explains that his

secret is pretending to cry, and gloats, ``I can turn it on like

a faucet.''



I'll never trust another old person...

-- Bart realizes Grampa duped him, ``War of the Simpsons''



At the bait shop...



Clerk: Yep, `General Sherman'. They say he's five hundred pounds of

bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know. No one knows how old he is, but

if you ask me (and most people do), he's hundred years if he's a day.

Customer: And uh no one's ever caught him?

Clerk: Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet

tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. His eyes were like steel,

cold, hard. Had a shock of hair, red like the fires of Hell.

Watch Lisa's mouth when she says the word `have' during her final scene

with Mr. Bergstrom. She curls her lower lip into her mouth, and you can

see her teeth poking out from under her top lip. This happens also when

Mr. Bergstrom says a word with the letter `v' in it, but it's more

noticeable with Lisa.



From the 29 Apr 91 USA TODAY:



MRS. ROBINSON:

If you saw Fox's `The Simpsons' Thursday, you may have noticed a new voice

in the credits---Sam Enid [sic]. Enid's voice sure sounded familiar,

almost like Dustin Hoffman. And gee, there sure were a lot of references

in `The Simpsons' to Hoffman's first hit, `The Graduate', thrown into a

story about Lisa falling into love with her substitute teacher. Shazam!

It turns out Enid is none other than Hoffman, whose contract with `The

Simpsons' stated that his real name could not be used on the credits or in

publicity.



Marc Colten (colten@cbnewsb.cb.att.com):



* Lisa found a truly good and wise teacher---and he left.



* She called her father a baboon and Bart agreed ("... I never thought _she'd_

be the one to say it").



* Homer then goes "3 for 3". How?

- He acts like a baboon in front of his daughter. She loves him, but she'll

never respect him. His attitude was that "Yeah, I'm a baboon, learn to

live with it."

- He then went to Bart and convinced him to aim low and be a jerk the rest

of his life. What an accomplishment.

- Then he gives his baby daughter her pacifier. Wow, what a father!



I don't think there's much to "feel good" about this episode. As Lisa

observed in another episode [Dead Putting Society], she'll be telling all this

to a psychiatrist some day.



Paul Kornreich (etzhadat@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu):



One of the important themes of this show was to respect people as they are and

not try to mold them into the ideal images that we want them to be. The main

example is of course Lisa's need for understanding throughout the episode.

However, just as important, except slightly more hidden, is the fact that she

must accept her parents and brother as they are. This is evidenced by the

following additional scenes.



* Lisa notices Bart's classmates cheering him and makes some remark that you'll

never fail by appealing to the lowest common denominator. Mr. Bergstrom

then, as well as assuring Lisa that she will one day be successful warns her

that she will miss her brother.



* In my favorite scene in the laundry room, Lisa gushes about her crush on Mr.

Bergstrom. She then tries to tell Marge that her love for Mr. Bergstrom is

"different" (=> more real) than Marge's love for Homer. Marge finally snaps

at Lisa and tells her that if she expects Marge to understand her crush, she

is going to have to accept the fact that Marge loves Homer.



* [re Homer's visit to Bart] Assuming that Bart, like MG, is not stupid, but

instead has an artistic bent Homer correctly surmised that Bart would not be

happy with the responsibilities that class presidency brings. His campaign

was somewhat of a joke anyway.



* [re Homer's visit to Maggie] If babies don't see something right in front of

them, they sometimes think the object is gone. Maggie finds the pacifier

necessary as she goes through teething. On top of all this the room was

dark, and she was probably groping for it. The simple act (to us) of this

restoration was a great relief to Maggie.



In short (cliche and pun aside), the little things DO mean a lot.



When Lisa plays her sax, notice that the baseball diamond is pointing away

from the school building. (A good idea.) Unfortunately, there is no backstop

and there is a tree in left-center field.



When Homer is in Lisa's room trying to cheer her up, Lisa's vanity has a

mirror with three photos taped to it (an elf, etc). In most of the scenes,

the photos eclipse Homer when he is seen in the mirror, but at one point,

Homer is eclipsing the photos, as if the photos are not on the mirror but

on the wall behind him.



Mary Claire Pugh (pug2@ellis.uchicago.edu) and Merlyn LeRoy (merlyn@digibd.com)

were the first to point this out.



The Springfield Museum of Natural History had burnt down in `Moaning

Lisa' [7[FG]06]. {cjb}



At 9:15am, while Lisa reads a book, her classmates are throwing things

around the classroom.



1: Did you hear about Miss Hoover?

She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.

2: Oh, I heard she fell down a well.

[Principal Skinner comes in with Miss Hoover, who is crying]

Lisa: My God, she's been dumped again...

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Miss Hoover: [shakily] Children, I won't be staying long.

I just came from the doctor, and I have lyme disease.

Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.

Ralph: What's lyme disease?

Pr. Skinner: I'll field that one. [goes to blackboard] Lyme disease

is spread by small parasites called `ticks'. [writes `TICKS'

on blackboard] When a diseased tick attaches itself to

you, it begins sucking your blood...

Miss Hoover: [not calmed] Oh...

Pr. Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infect your bloodstream, eventually

spreading to your spinal fluid and on into the brain.

Miss Hoover: The brain!? Oh, dear God...

Class: Wow!

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Until the substitute teacher arrives, Principal Skinner teaches the class.



[a scream is heard from the room above]

Skinner: Bart Simpson! I know it's you!

-- Principal Skinner fills in for Miss Hoover, ``Lisa's Substitute''



For Show-and-Tell, Bart shows a videotape, titled, `How kittens are born:

The UGLY story'.



Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in!

-- Bart shows a videotape of kittens being born, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Back downstairs, Principal Skinner teaches the class about the schwa.



Bergstrom: [enters the classroom, guns ablazin']

Skinner: Are you the substitute?

Bergstrom: Yessir, yes I aim.

Skinner: Are you insane?

-- Principal Skinner doesn't quite get Bergstrom's unorthodox teaching

technique, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom takes over and asks the class to find three things wrong

with his costume. Lisa raises her hand and lists them. Her third point

was that Mr. Bergstrom appears Jewish, but there were no Jewish cowboys.

Mr. Bergstrom rewards her with his hat, though he intended the third

point to be that he is wearing a digital watch.



And, for the record, there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen.

Big guys who were great shots and spent money freely.

-- Mr. Bergstrom's lesson on the American West, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom introduces himself and suggests ways the class could make

fun of his name. Ms. Krabappel begins the process of electing a class

president, and she endorses Martin, who gives his nomination speech.



Martin: As your president, I would demand a science-fiction library,

featuring an ABC of the over[something] genre. Asimov,

Bester, Clarke!

Student: What abouy Ray Bradbury?

Martin: [dismissing] I'm aware of his work...

[orating] Thank you, and... Keep watching the skies...

-- Martin's campaign speech for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



During the cookie break, Mr. Bergstrom sings `Home on the Range'

(with editorial commentary) to the class, and the kids pass to Lisa a

picture of `the singing dork'. Mr. Bergstrom catches Lisa with it. She

insists she didn't draw it, though that doesn't seem to bother him. The

kids then pass to her a picture of `the singing dorkette'.

Sherri and Terri nominate Bart to run against Martin, and Ms. Krabappel

sends Bart out of the room. Bart does the blowfish on the door window.

Downstairs, Mr. Bergstrom finishes reading <Charlotte's Web> to the class.

Later, he asks the students in turn to demonstrate their special talent.

When it's Lisa's turn, he asks about her saxophone, but she refuses to

play it. After school, Lisa eavesdrops on a conversation and sees

Mr. Bergstrom spurn Ms. Krabappel's advances. Lisa sighs admiringly.

Outside on the playground, Lisa plays her sax for Mr. Bergstrom,

who watches from the classroom window.

[End of Act One. Time: 6:52]

While helping Marge fold the laundry, Lisa gushes about her crush on

Mr. Bergstrom and has trouble believing that Marge feels the same way

about Homer. Homer and Bart make fun of the fact that Mr. Bergstrom

cried when he read the end of <Charlotte's Web>.

At school, Lisa's class is dismissed for lunch, and Mr. Bergstrom calls

Lisa aside.



Mr. Bergstrom: Lisa, your homework is always so neat.

How can I put this? Does your father help you with it.

Lisa: No. Homework's not my father's specialty.

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa is not very flattering in her description of Homer. Meanwhile,

the campaign for class president continues.



Martin: [campaign speech] In a sample taken in this very classroom,

a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos!

Bart: That's not enough! We demand MORE asbestos!

[leads the class in a chant of `MORE ASBESTOS']

-- Martin and Bart run for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



The campaign confrontation makes the front page of `The Daily Fourth Grader',

headlined, ``Bart to Martin: Eat my shorts!''



Homer: Wow! You made the front page!

Bart: Aw, Dad, it's just a popularity contest?

Homer: JUST a popularity contest?

Excuse me. What's more important than popularity?

-- Bart runs for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



I always knew you had personality.

The doctor said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better.

-- Homer is pleased that Bart's running for class president,

``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer inspires Bart to ``Go get 'im!'' The campaign continues...



He says there aren't any easy answers.

I say, he's not looking hard enough!

-- Bart's campaign speech against Martin, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Martin's Poster: A Vote for Bart is a Vote for Anarchy!

Bart's Poster: A Vote for Bart is a Vote for Anarchy! [scrawled]

-- The campaign for class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer helps Bart make a campaign poster: ``Sex! Now that I've got your

attention, vote for Bart!'' And on the playground, Bart hold up one

of Martin's campaign flyers and wipes the seat of his pants with it.

Lisa and Mr. Bergstrom watch from the classroom window.



You'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator.

-- Lisa comments on Bart's campaign antics, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom tells Lisa that she'll miss her brother when she goes on to

better things. Lisa says she believes everything he says.

The class write get-well letters to Miss Hoover, and when class is

dismissed, Mr. Bergstrom mentions that the Springfield Museum of Natural

History is closing due to lack of interest, and urges that they go see it

while they can. At home...



Marge: Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow,

and I think you should take her.

Homer: Museum? Tomorrow? Oh, oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning

on... [thinks to himself] Sleeping? Eating a big sandwich? Watching

TV? Spending time with the boy! [speaks up] Spending time with the

boy! The boy needs attention, Marge.

Marge: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa, and I'm concerned about your

relationship with her.

Bart: Me too, Mom. I think you're drifting apart.

Homer: Shut up, boy.

Marge: Homer, please.

Homer: Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because...

[thinking to himself] You're trapped. If you were smarter, you

might think of something. But you're not, so you just might as

well... [speaks up] All right, all right, I'll take her.

[sotto voce] Lousy brain.

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer takes Lisa to the museum and sees the sign,

`Suggested donation: $4.50'.



Homer: Eh, what do you mean by `suggested donation'?

Clerk: Pay any amount you wish, sir.

Homer: And uh, what if I wish to pay ... zero?

Clerk: That is up to you.

Homer: Ooh, so it's up to me, is it?

Clerk: Yes.

Homer: I see. And you think that people are going to pay

you $4.50 even though they don't have to?

Just out of the goodness of their... [laughs]

Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady, you're gonna need it!

-- Homer sees the sign `Suggested donation: $4.50' at the museum entrance,

``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. Bergstrom coincidentally arrives, and he joins Homer and Lisa.

Mr. Bergstrom lectures on dinosaurs and mummification...



Ooh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than the Wolf Man.

-- Homer admires the mummy at the museum, ``Lisa's Substitute''



While Homer admires, Lisa leaves with Mr. Bergstrom.

At the museum snack bar, while Lisa entertains herself with a static

electricity demonstration, Mr. Bergstrom tells Homer that Lisa needs

a strong male role model.



She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education,

youthful looks, and a clean credit record, and thinks, ``Why me? What

did I do to deserve this fat old piece of...'' [cries]

-- Homer talks to Mr. Bergstrom on Lisa's need for a strong male role model,

``Lisa's Substitute''



Mr. B: There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.

Homer: Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A!

Mr. B: I <am> giving her an A.

Homer: Great, but don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.

Mr. B: Mr. Simpson, she <did> earn it.

Homer: You are smooth, I'll give you that.

-- On Lisa's education, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Homer joins Lisa at the static electricity exhibit.

At home, Lisa tells Marge that Homer ruined her one chance to get to

know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.



Marge: Why don't we invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?

Lisa: Oh, Mom! That's wonderful!

Can I find out his favorite dish and help you make it?

Marge: Sure.

Lisa: Can I wear your jewelry?

Marge: Sure.

Lisa: Can I get my ears pierced?

Marge: No.

Lisa: Can I dye my shoes pink?

Marge: Yes.

Lisa: Can I paint my nails?

Marge: No.

Lisa: Can we have wine?

Marge: Yes.

Lisa: Can I have wine?

Marge: No.

Lisa: Does Bart have to be there?

Marge: Yes.

Lisa: Can we do it this week?

-- Setting the ground rules, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Outside the classroom door, Lisa rehearses inviting Mr. Bergstrom to dinner.

But when she comes in, she sees Miss Hoover erasing Mr. Bergstrom's name

from the blackboard... ``Good morning, Lisa. I'm back.''

[End of Act Two. Time: 13:22]



Miss Hoover: You see, class, my lyme disease turned out to be

[spells it on the board] psychosomatic.

Ralph: Does that mean you're crazy?

Student 2: No, that means she was faking it.

Miss Hoover: No, actually, it was a little of both.

-- Miss Hoover returns to teaching, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Miss Hoover is miffed that Mr. Bergstrom didn't touch her lesson plan

and asks what he taught the class. Lisa says, ``That life is worth

living,'' and rushes out of the classroom in tears. Ms. Krabappel

announces that the polls will be open until the end of recess. The

candidates are invited to make their final statements. Martin is too

shaky to say much of anything. Bart announces, ``Victory party under

the slide!''

Lisa arrives at Mr. Bergstrom's apartment, but he moved out, having

gotten an assignment in Capital City.

At recess, Bart hands out cupcakes, but learns that nobody actually

voted. Not even Milhouse or Lewis. When the bell rings, Bart realizes

that <he> forgot to vote.

In the classroom, Martin and Wendell jump for joy.



Bart: I demand a recount!

Ms. K: [counts the votes] One for Martin. Two for Martin.

Would you like another recount?

Bart: [realizing he's beat] No.

Ms. K: [enjoying it] Well, I just want to make sure.

One for Martin. Two for Martin. [chuckles]

-- The Apathy Party loses again, ``Lisa's Substitute''



At the train station, Lisa catches Mr. Bergstrom as he's about to board

the train to Capital City. Lisa begs him not to leave.



That's the problem with being middle-class.

Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.

-- Mr. Bergstrom's parting remarks, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa tearfully understands. He tells her, ``Whenever you feel that you're

alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know,''

and hands her a note. Lisa chases the train as it pulls away, then looks

at the note. It reads, ``You are Lisa Simpson.''

At the dinner table ...



Bart didn't get one vote?

Oh, this is the worst thing that could ever happen to us!

-- Homer, on Bart failing to be elected class president, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa is upset about Mr. Bergstrom's leaving.



Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand!

-- Homer tries to understand Lisa, ``Lisa's Substitute''



Lisa finally snaps...



Lisa: You, sir, are a baboon!

Homer: [gasp] Me?

Lisa: Yes, you! Baboon! Baboon! Baboon! Baboon!

Homer: I don't think you realize what you're saying...

Lisa: BABOON! [leaves in tears]

Bart: Whoa. Somebody was bound to say it someday, I just can't believe

it was her.

-- ``Lisa's Substitute''



Marge tells Homer to talk to Lisa. Ignoring the `Go Away' sign on her door,

Homer tries to cheer Lisa up, with no success. He makes a `monkey' joke and

dances around the room like a gorilla. This works. Homer goes to Bart,

who is upset at having lost the election. But Homer points out that the

class president has to do extra work and doesn't get to do anything neat.

This works. He then goes to Maggie's room and giver her her pacifier.

He comes downstairs to the kitchen, and stops Marge from talking.

``Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life.''

Gary Bisaga {gb2} observes:



Right before Burns insults Homer's new reduced waistline, Homer is shown

standing in front of the staircase and two pictures are shown on the wall

behind him. One appears to be a baby picture of Bart, on all fours but with

the same spike hair. The other appears to be a female ancestor of Marge's,

looking just like Marge; she had blue hair done up like Marge's (and her

mother's) current style, except it didn't go up nearly as far - more of an

afro with a little peak on the top. It was in a little ellipsical frame.

The picture appears to be from the early part of the 20th century because

the dress she is wearing has mutton sleeves (those big puffy shoulder/sleeve

units that they wore back then). But the picture was in color (you can see

the hair is blue). They probably would not have given the woman that type of

dress unless they were attempting to portray a picture from, say, the 20's,

so I say the picture should have been B/W. What does everybody else say?



Audrey Rosen kindly provides the jumprope rhyme:

Lincoln, Lincoln, I've been thinkin'

What the heck have you been drinkin'?

Is it water? Is it wine?

Oh my gosh, it's turpentine!



Except that Lisa and Bart say `hell' instead of `heck', just to give it

a little more edge.

Chris Baird {cjb} notes that paintings of Monty Burns already existed,

such as the painting of a younger (blushing) Burns in his office in

`Homer's Odyssey'.



The Rolling Donut

Jym Dyer {jd} explains (for the benefit of non-Americans) that a common

American unpleasantry is to tell somebody (presumably male) to `go take a

flying fuck at a rolling donut.' On a visit to Los Angeles, Mr. Dyer

found a shop named

It has since been taken over by Dunkin' Donuts, but the sign remains.

Homer: Yes!

Bart+Lisa Thanks, dad!

-- The persistence of memory? ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer has trouble fitting into his swimsuit (which doesn't leave much to

the imagination), nor does he find it easy to get into the car without

his spare tire hitting the horn. When they arrive...



Everybody stick together. We don't want to get separ...

[turns around, everybody is gone] D'oh!

-- Homer's instructions to the family at Mt. Splashmore,

``Brush with Greatness''



Challenge the raging water of DEATH.

Dare to discover what water is really made of!

H2WHOA!

-- Mt. Splashmore announcer, ``Brush with Greatness''



Bart is pleased that there is no line, but he's mistaken.



Bart: Okay, Lis. Turn on the water works, babe.

Lisa: [crying] Mommy! I want my mommy! [sob sob]

-- How to get to the front of the line for a ride at Mt. Splashmore,

``Brush with Greatness''



Lisa, then Bart go down. Marge watches Maggie in the kiddie pool.

Homer gets to the front of the H2WHOA line by claiming to be the

line inspector, and when he goes down, he gets stuck. One technician

notes, ``It's too big to be human'' and tells the spotter to send

down some kids to dislodge it. They don't, and the section of pipe

has to be removed to get Homer out. The family watch the TV news.



Eyewitnesses estimate the man's weight at somewhere between four and

five hundred pounds.

-- Newscaster on Homer's getting stuck in the water slide,

``Brush with Greatness''



Krusty: [surrounded by reporters]

No, this slide is perfectly safe. This was an isolated incident.

Kent Brockman: I understand that Krusty... [lost in the reporters' yelling]

Krusty! Was that exactly what you said just before the recall of

tainted `Krusty Brand Mayonnaise'?

Krusty: Now kids, you know that question is out of bounds.

This interview is over.

-- ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer: All right, family. I want the truth. Don't pull any punches.

[sweetly] Am I just a little bit overweight?

[silence]

[angrily] Well, am I?

Lisa: Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugar-coat a response.

-- Ooh, and a split infinitive, too, ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer weighs himself.



Oh! Four hundred and thirty-seven... Fifty pounds?

Oh my God! Three hundred and... A hundred and fifty?

OH! Ooh. OH! Ooh.

Oh my God! It's two hundred and sixty pounds!

I'm a big fat pig!

-- The ups and downs of dieting with a shaky scale, ``Brush with Greatness''



Marge: You do have big bones.

Homer: Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bones!

-- Homer finds he weighs 260 pounds, ``Brush with Greatness''



I am going on a diet.

From this day forward, I pledge there will be no pork chop too succulent!

No donut too tasty!

No pizza too laden with delicious toppings

to prevent me from reaching my scientifically-determined ideal weight!

As God as my witness, I'll always be hungry again!!

-- Homer, upon realizing he needs to lose weight, ``Brush with Greatness''



then his stomach growls. [End of Act 1. Time: 5:38]

Homer takes Bart up to the attic, where Bart scares Homer with the lights.



Bart: Hey, Homer, I found your weights.

Homer: [admiring] Oh, the Glutemus Maximizer...

-- Up in the attic, ``Brush with Greatness''



Bart stumbles across a large cache of paintings of Ringo Starr, signed

by `Marge B.', one of which depicts Ringo and Marge getting married.

Homer confronts Marge.



Marge: Oh Homer, don't be jealous. I was a schoolgirl.

The Beatles were very popular, and I had a crush on him.

Homer: A likely story...

-- Marge explains her collection of Ringo Starr paintings,

``Brush with Greatness''



At dinner...



Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?

-- Homer, setting out on his diet, ``Brush with Greatness''



Marge gives Homer steamed vegetables and rice cakes.



Hey, I've been setting my drinks on these things!

-- Homer admires a rice cake, ``Brush with Greatness''



Hello! Hello! Hello, taste? Where are you?

-- Homer bites into a rice cake, ``Brush with Greatness''



Marge suggests Homer could put something on it for flavor.



Hey Mom, these paintings are good.

While I know first-hand how fragile young talent is,

I'd love to hear the particulars of how <your> gift was squashed.

-- Lisa asking Marge to explain her schoolgirl painting talent,

``Brush with Greatness''



Marge tells her story of how Mr. Schindler scolded her for drawing Ringo,

and how she sent Ringo a picture of him for an honest opinion. But she

never got any response and never painted again.



Lisa: Maybe you could take a class at Springfield Community College.

Marge: I think it's a very nice idea. Don't you, Homer?

Homer: Do I have to do anything?

Marge: No.

Homer: Great! Fine! Go nuts!

-- A loving, supportive husband, ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer takes his rice cake out of the microwave, loaded with goodies.

``Mm. Only 35 calories.'' At SCC...



I've just enrolled in the screenwriting class.

I yearn to tell the story of an idealistic young Hindu,

pushed too far by convenience store bandits.

I call it `Hands Off My Jerky, Turkey'.

-- Apu, at Springfield Community College, ``Brush with Greatness''



With Lisa's moral support, Marge shows Prof. Lombardo her portfolio

and he lets her enrol in the painting class.



Marvelous!

-- Prof. Lombardo sees a handyman paint the handrail, ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer is wearing weights on his wrists and ankles, and he can't move.

Bart takes advantage of the situation and takes Homer's wallet. Back

at SCC...



Now, using the Lombardo method, you learn to see everyday objects

as a simple grrouping of geometrical shapes. Heah, we see how two

concentric circles, various trapezoids, ellipses, and yes! even a rrhombus!

can create an adorable little bunny-rabbit. It's just that easy!

-- Professor Lombardo's art lecture, ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer tries to lift weights, he skips rope with Bart and Lisa (as Marge

`visualizes' him geometrically), and he tries a second time to lift

weights, and suceeds after all the weights fall off and he raises just the

bar. At SCC...



Bravo! Walk away from it. Now it belongs to the ages.

[to next student]

You! Not another stroke! Oh well, maybe one more, that's it! Perfect!

-- Professor Lombardo's art lecture, ``Brush with Greatness''



Prof. Lombardo is very impressed with Marge's work and enters her `Bald

Adonis' in the Springfield Art Exhibition.



Marge, please, I don't take praise very well!

[sees a sign painter]

Oh! Another triumph!

-- Prof. Lombardo, ``Brush with Greatness''



At the art show, Marge wins first prize. At the power plant, Burns

bawls out yet another artist hired to paint his portrait for the

opening of the Burns Wing of the museum. Smithers discards the painting

into a room filled with other failed paintings.



Damnation, Smithers. This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait

was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!

-- Burns chews out Smithers, ``Brush with Greatness''



Smithers notes that Burns has alienated every artist in town. Then suggests



Smithers: Mrs. Homer Simpson.

Burns: Who?

Smithers: She won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair,

and she's the wife of an employee, she'll be easily

intimidated.

Burns: Excellent.

-- Searching for an artist to do Burns' portrait, ``Brush with Greatness''



Burns: Somebody up there likes me, Smithers.

Smithers: Somebody down here likes you, too, sir.

Burns: Shut up.

-- Too much of a good thing? ``Brush with Greatness''



[End of Act 2. Time: 11:41]

Homer weighs himself again (again with a shake scale), and he weighs 249.

He comes down and announces it to the family.



Marge: That's wonderful, isn't it kids?

Lisa: [to Bart] Pass the moo juice.

Marge: Kids, remember what I told you about showing a little support?

Lisa: Way to go, Dad!

Bart: You look mahvelous!

Maggie: [toasts Homer with her bottle of formula]

-- Homer reaches his weight goal, ``Brush with Greatness''



At the plant...



Donut man: Hey, what gives? These donuts are piling up.

Worker: Heh. Yeah, Homer Simpson went on a diet.

Donut man: Oh my God. And I just bought a boat! [slaps forehead]

-- Homer's diet depresses the local economy, ``Brush with Greatness''



Burns struggles to rap the knocker on the Simpsons' door, and Smithers

bangs on the door until Marge answers. They invite themselves in.



Smithers: Have you ever painted the rich and powerful?

Marge: Well, no. Just Ringo Starr.

Burns: Ring-Go?

Smithers: He was the drummer for a rock-and-roll combo called

the Beatles, sir.

Burns: Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I seem to remember their off-key

caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. What <was> Ed thinking?

-- Burns commissions Marge to paint his portrait, ``Brush with Greatness''



Burns requires that Marge make him look beautiful, and she agrees.

Posing for the portrait...



Smithers: Ah, sir. At least the world will see you as I always have.

Burns: [trying to get him to shut up] Yes, yes, yes.

-- Preparing for a portrait, ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer arrives home and panics when he sees Burns. He takes Marge into

the kitchen and begs her to make him look handsome. Marge assures Homer

that all she needs to do is find his inner beauty. She returns to work.



Marge: What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns?

Did you have a dog that you loved?

Burns: Well... Daah! There's something on my leg. [waves his leg]

Get it off! Get it off! [Maggie is clutching his leg] Ugh!

Marge: [takes Maggie, holds her up] Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.

Maggie: [suck suck suck]

Burns: [still scared] Ooh!

-- Trying to find Mr. Burns' `inner beauty', ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer: All right, all right. Who took the funny pages?

Smithers: [reading to Burns] So Ziggy goes to the repair shop,

there's a sign on the doorbell reading `out of order'.

Burns: Heh heh. Ah, Ziggy. Will you ever win?

-- ``Brush with Greatness''



While collecting laundry, Marge accidentally bursts in on Burns

naked in the bathroom. She backs out, apologetically.



Bart: Hey Mom, did he have those spots all over his body?

Burns: [opens the door] I heard that.

-- Marge accidentally bursts in on Burns (naked) in the bathroom,

``Brush with Greatness''



Smithers: Would you feel more comfortable if I left, too, sir?

Burns: Of course not, Smithers. You're. You're like a doctor.

-- Marge catches Burns naked in the bathroom, ``Brush with Greatness''



In the kitchen...



Burns: [off camera] Smithers! I want my tea!

Marge: Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?

Smithers: Oh ho ho. Actually, I value every second we're together.

From the moment I squeeze his orange juice in the morning,

til I tuck him in at night.

He's not just my boss. He's my best friend, too.

Burns: [sipping the tea] Bah! Too hot! [spills it on Smithers]

Smithers: Right, sir. It's scalding me as we speak.

-- ``Brush with Greatness''



Meanwhile, somewhere in England... Ringo is surrounded by bags of

mail with the word `mail' on them, in various languages.



Dear Sally. In response to you letter of December the 12th 1966,

me favourite colour is blue, and me real first name is Richard.

Thanks for the snapshot. You're a real cute bird. Love, Ringo.

PS: Forgive the lateness of my reply.

-- Ringo Starr answering his backlogged fan mail, ``Brush with Greatness''



Ringo explains to his butler that he insists on responding to every

single piece of fan mail. The next letter is Marge's painting.

Meanwhile, back in Springfield... Burns snaps at Lisa's saxophone

playing. Marge scolds him, but he tells Marge to shut up and paint.

Homer steps onto the scale, and he weighs 239 pounds.



Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt!

-- Homer is proud of his weight loss, ``Brush with Greatness''



Burns tells Homer he's the fattest man he's ever seen.



If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator. [leaves, crying]

--Homer reacts to Burns' insulting his weight, ``Brush with Greatness''



Marge sends Burns away, then stops Homer from spraying whipped cream

directly into his mouth. Marge has lost faith in her painting

ability. A letter comes in for Marge...



Dear Marge. Thanks for the fab painting of Yours Truly. I hung

it on me wall. You're quite an artist. In answer to your question,

yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England. But we call French

fries `chips'. Love, Ringo. PS: Forgive the lateness of my reply.

-- Ringo Starr answering his backlogged fan mail, ``Brush with Greatness''



Homer tells Marge she can do it, and she sets to work. Marge paints

with Homer, Lisa, and Maggie watching. Later, Homer has left, and Lisa

and Maggie look sleepy. Even later, Lisa has gone, and Maggie is asleep

on the floor. Marge gets inspired and starts on a fresh canvas. At

the museum...



Friends, art lovers, security personnel...

-- Burns begins his speech on the opening of the Burns wing of the

art museum, ``Brush with Greatness''



The painting is unveiled, and it depicts Burns, naked. All are shocked

at first, but Marge gives a touching speech.



He's bad, but he'll die. So I like it.

-- Art critic, on Marge's portrait of Mr. Burns, ``Brush with Greatness''



You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate.

And... I don't hate this."

-- Burns to Marge on her portrait of him, ``Brush with Greatness''



Burns: Thanks for not making fun of my genitalia.

Marge: [sotto voce] I thought I did.

Stacey Fielding (an665@cleveland.Freenet.Edu) observes:



It wasn't just that is said "I will not grease the monkey bars."

It was the way it was arranged on the chalkboard:



I will not grease the monkey

bars.



...that lead me to believe we now have our first Simpson's

masturbation reference. Well, Bart <is> getting close to that age.

The `Monroe Box' is a spoof of B. F. Skinner's controversial `Skinner Box'.

I'm sorry I didn't mention this the first time I posted the article; I assumed

that everybody was familiar with it.



The family drop Grampa off at the retirement home after another miserable

`third Sunday of the month' outing with Grampa. Marge scolds them for

not treating Grampa with respect.



Marge: You know, <we'll> be old someday.

Homer: Gasp! My God, you're right, Marge! You kids wouldn't put me in a home

like I did to my dad, would you?

Bart: [considering the idea] Well...

Homer: Aaah!

-- After another miserable Sunday with Grampa, ``Old Money''



The family debate what they should do next month, and after some debate,

all agree to go to Discount Lion Safari. Grampa returns to his room, then

goes downstairs for his pills. His pills are mixed up with those of

Bea Simmons, and the two hit it off. They eat their pills seductively...



Well, I was wondering if you and I you know, might go to the same place

at the same time and... Jeez! You'd think this would get easier with time!

-- Grampa asks Bea Simmons out, ``Old Money''



Grampa preens himself for his date, and they go dancing, and lots of other

stuff. Grampa goes to Herman to buy Bea a birthday gift, and Herman points

him at Grandma's World...



Yo, active wear? Need a price check on a wool shoal.

-- Clerk at `Grandma's World', ``Old Money''



Homer pays Grampa a visit on the third Sunday of the month, and when Grampa

says it's his girlfriend Bea's birthday, Homer greets an empty chair

(thinking Grampa's friend is imaginary) and drags Grampa out. They take

him to Discount Lion Safari...



Do not feed the animals. Do not allow animals inside the car.

Do not make eye contact with animals.

-- Lisa reads the instruction pamphlet for Discount Lion Safari, ``Old Money''



They wander off the official route, get stuck in the mud, and are attacked

by lions. The next morning, the lions are scared off by a gunshot...



Mr. Simpson, I presume.

-- Very British `Discount Lion Safari' guide, ``Old Money''



Grampa returns home to see the paramedics taking Bea's body away.



You know, Jasper, they may say she died of a burst ventricle, but I know

she died of a broken heart.

-- Grampa mourns Bea's passing, ``Old Money''



At the funeral...



You can tell she really cared for me. She didn't make me a pallbearer.

-- Grampa watches the pallbearers struggle with the casket, ``Old Money''



Homer: I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad.

Grampa: Is someone talking to me? I didn't hear anything.

Homer: Oh no! Dad's lost his hearing!

-- Grampa disowns Homer, ``Old Money''



In his room, Grampa is greeted by Lionel Hutz, the executor of Bea's estate,

and learns she left everything to him.



Hutz: There is one catch... You must spend one night in... a haunted house!

Grampa: [gasp!]

Hutz: Just kidding.

-- Grampa inherits $106,000, ``Old Money''



Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it. It looks

just like a cigar. Isn't that something!

-- Lionel Hutz leaves a calling card, ``Old Money''



Grampa phones Homer to tell him he isn't getting one thin dime. The

home director makes a play for the money, and Grampa throws him out.



Grampa: Has it ever occurred to you that old folks deserve to be treated

like human beings! whether they have money or not?

Director: Yes, but it passes.

-- The retirement home director tries to get his hands on... ``Old Money''



Grampa returns to Herman's and buys a fez, allegedly once worn by Napoleon.

He goes to various `exciting' places and yawns at each. While at

Dis-nee-land ...



Oh, Abraham, calm down. I'm not here to scare you. They've got me haunting

a family in Texas.

-- Bea's ghost appears, ``Old Money''



She suggests that, since he isn't enjoying the money, he give it to a worthy

cause. Meanwhile, Marge suggests that Homer talk to somebody about his

depression...



Hiya. You have reached Doctor Marvin Monroe's anxiety line.

If you have a sullen teenager, press `1'.. NOW!

If you are estranged from your spouse, press `2'... NOW!

If you have trouble maintaining an...

-- ``Old Money''



Grampa pays a surprise visit, and the two reconcile. Over dinner, Grampa

announces that he's going to interview for worthy causes for Bea's money.

Outside the retirement home, Kent Brockman does his news report. Inside

Grampa listens to pitches from Otto, Mr. Burns, Moe, Dr. Marvin Monroe...



Monroe: It's a special isolation chamber. The subject pulls levers to receive

food and water. The floor can become electrified, and showers of

icy water randomly fall on the subject. I call it... The Monroe Box!

Grampa: Uh huh. Sounds interesting. How much will it cost to build?

Monroe: Oh, that's the beauty part! It's already built! I need the money

to buy a baby to raise in the box until the age of thirty.

Grampa: What are you trying to prove?

Monroe: Well, my theory is that the subject will be socially maladjusted and

will harbor a deep resentment towards me.

Grampa: Mm. Interesting.

-- Everybody wants to get their hands on... ``Old Money''



from Bart, a crazy inventor with a death ray...



Man: With proper funding, I'm confident this little baby could destroy

an area the size of New York City.

Grampa: But I want to help people, not kill them!

Man: Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has <evil> applications...

-- Everybody wants to get their hands on... ``Old Money''



and even Lisa...



Lisa: The people who deserve it are on the streets, and they're in the slums.

They're little children who need more library books, and they're

families who can't make ends meet. Of course, if you really wanted

to, you could buy me a pony.

Grampa: You're right!

Lisa: I'll name her Princess, and I'll ride her every day!

-- Lisa suggests how Grampa could spend his... ``Old Money''



Grampa realizes Lisa is right and takes a walk through the run-down part

of town. He returns to the retirement home and realizes that $100,000

isn't enough. Jasper suggests going to the casino. While Otto drives

the bus of old elderly folk, Homer chases after it. As Grampa changes

his money into chips, Homer pulls into a Krusty Burger...



Homer: A double cheeseburger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and

for God's sakes, hurry!

Voice: [unintelligible, thanks to the poor-quality microphone]

-- The drive-through window of a Krusty Burger, ``Old Money''



Homer arrives at the casino and finds that Grampa is actually winning.



Grampa: I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: If you can make one heap

of all your winnings and risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

and lose, and start again at your beginnings, and never breathe

a word about your loss, yours is the earth is everything that is

in it, and, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.

Homer: You'll be a bonehead!

-- Trying to stop Grampa from risking it all at the casino, ``Old Money''



Grampa: Put it all on 41. [nudges Homer] I've got a feeling about that number.

Roulette man: The wheel only goes to 36.

Grampa: Okay, put it all on 36.

[nudges Homer] I've got a feeling about that number.

-- Grampa at the casino, ``Old Money''



Homer successfully stops Grampa from risking (and losing) everything.

Grampa sees his friends piling onto the bus for the ride home and decides

where his money should go: He spends it on sprucing up the Springfield

Retirement Castle and creating the Beatrice Simmons Dining Room.

Bart's Dog Gets an F Written by Jon Vitti

Directed by Jim Reardon

Tracey Ullman is the voice of a dog-obedience schoolmarm as Bart has the

grumps, Lisa the mumps, and Homer new $125 sneakers---until the family dog

gets hold of them. Other voices include Harry Shearer.



Blackboard :- `I will not sell school / property'.

`I will not sell schoo' at cutoff.



Driveway :- no oil on the driveway.

Homer does not shake his fist at Bart.

Homer says `D'oh!' when Lisa scoots past.



Couch: :- All fit, including the pets.



... Tracey Ullman provided the voice of the obedience trainer,

Miss Winthrop?

... the Nev-R-Break dog collar that broke?

... While Sylvia Winfield is on the phone, Santa's Little Helper gets

out of the pool, shakes himself dry, then jumps back in?

... at work, Homer kept his feet over the monitors?

... the studly way Marge threads a needle?

... the ad campaign for the sneaker was `Assasins: Join the Conspiracy'?

... Homer's vanity sneaker license plate reads... `Homer'?

(Ned's was `Ned'.)

... the camera angle from inside Lisa's mouth at the doctor's office?

[Let's see you do <that> with human actors!]

... the Killer Babysitter on the news?

... Krusty the Klown is on the Joe Franklin Show?

... Nancy Cartwright provided the voice of the Big Cookie girl?

... not only did Homer say `macamadamia', but he also spelled it that

way on his note? (It also took him ten minutes write the note.

He started at 8:55 and ended at 9:05.)

... Miss Winthrop was reading `JOCO', the Journal of Canine Obedience?



... the original airing was cut to make room for `Deep Deep Trouble'?



Dave Hall (dave@sys6626.bison.mb.ca) also points out:

... the `NEW-R-BREAK' dog collar cost 89 cents.

... the red light flashing on the console behind Homer.

... Jacques has also enrolled his poodle at Canine College.

... There appears to be a "Itchy" (or is it Scratchy?) painting above the

fireplace in the T.V. soap scene.

... when Homer shows off his `Assassin' sneakers, there appears to be a

hyphen separating the `A'. (Think about it.)

... when Homer brings his `Assassins' back, a man in the background, under

the `Kick Boxing' sign", gives a karate kick to another man. Note the

next sign says: `Street Crime'.

... the Salesperson sort of reminds me of Side-Show Bob, or that guy from

`Eraser Head'.

... the dog buyer does something with his left hand that causes SLH to yelp.



Predator

- When we switch to the dog's point of view, we hear a little

explosion sound. The same sound is used in the movie when we

switch to the alien's point of view.

The Far Side

- How human speech sounds to dogs.

Corby Page (spike@moriah.cs.dartmouth.edu) notes that Marge refers to it as

the Bouvier Family Quilt, which doesn't make sense because it is passed down

through the women of each generation.



Bart is wrong when he claims they've never had a family meeting before.

See [7[FG]04].



Dr.H's kitchen is the same as Dr.H's kitchen.

He was wearing a Cosby sweater.



And, to rub it in, the next commercial break when the episode was first

aired was a Jell-O commercial with the man himself.

Homer retrieves his morning paper, which Santa's Little Helper (SLH)

playfully shreds with his teeth. Meanwhile, Marge wakes Lisa for school...

Marge: Oh, Homer, there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here.

Bart: Oh, school, right, yeah, that's your answer to everything...

-- finding a school for Santa's Little Helper,

``Bart's Dog Gets an F''



Marge chooses a school run by Miss Winthrop. On the first day of class, she

demonstrates use of the choke chain.



Martin: How can we tell if we're doing this maneuver effectively?

Miss Winthrop: The dog's eyes will cross, and his tongue will protrude and

change color, ever so slightly.

Bart: Is my dog dead, Ma'am?

Miss Winthrop: Ah ha ha, you don't know how often I'm asked that.

`Choke chain' is a misnomer.

Trust me. They are always breathing.

... and discuss the future of SLH as he causes more minor havoc.

Back in school, Bart tries to get SLH to sit, while a dog walks by with

a book balanced on its head, and another walks on its hind legs. The dogs

are lined up, and they roll over in perfect synchronicity, except for SLH,

who wets on the rug. Bart cleans up the mess, accompanied by an appropriate

tongue-lashing from Miss Winthrop. Meanwhile, Homer fails to get a refund

on the ASSASSINS (tm)...



I'm sorry, sir, our warranty doesn't cover fire, theft, or acts of dog.

-- shoe store clerk, ``Bart's Dog Gets an F''



... but succeeds in discovering a cookie sale.



Girl: Aloha! Would you like a free sample?

Homer: The price is right! [stuffs them furiously into his mouth]

Mmm.. Ooh.. Macamadamia nuts.

Girl: If you'd like to buy some, they're only a dollar each.

Homer: Oh, so <that's> your little plan. Get us addicted, then jack

up the price! [as he talks, cookie crumbs splatter out of his

mouth, dirtying up his shirt] ... [meekly] Well, you win.

-- at the Cookie Collossus store, ``Bart's Dog Gets an F''



Homer brings the cookie home, but no sooner has he left it in the kitchen

than SLH begins to stalk it. Lisa makes her contribution to the quilt.



Look Mom, I've finished my patch.

It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.

[cough cough]

On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher at school?

He taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of

its beauty and soul.

And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy.

He taught me that music is a fire in your belly that comes out

of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it.

-- Lisa describes her contribution to the Bouvier Memory Quilt.

``Bart's Dog Gets an F''



After a good drink from the commode, SLH wanders through the house and

stalks the quilt. Marge and Lisa bring Homer upstairs to see the quilt.



Marge: [weeping] My quilt! Six generations, ruined!

Homer: Now Marge, honey honey honey. Come on, come on, don't get upset.

It's not the end of the world. We all love that quilt,

but we can't get too attached to... OHH!!! MY COOKIE!!!

-- Homer tries to console Marge after Santa's Little Helper

chews up the quilt (and Homer's cookie) ``Bart's Dog Gets an F''



Homer: Everybody in the kitchen. We're having a family meeting.

Bart: We never had a family meeting before...

Homer: We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.

-- what to do about Santa's Little Helper? ``Bart's Dog Gets a F''



Through SLH's eyes (and ears), we see Homer announce that the dog must go.

[End of Act Two. Time: 14:31]

The family meeting continues...



Lisa: I'm sure Mom agrees with me.

Marge: Mmm. No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.

Homer: You do? [taunting and dancing] Ha ha ha ha ha.

-- what to do about Santa's Little Helper? ``Bart's Dog Gets a F''



Lisa: This is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition,

but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the

way to solve a problem with something we love is to throw it away?

Homer: [weeping] Oh, Lisa. If they're ever going to pull the plug on me,

I want you in my corner, honey.

-- what to do about Santa's Little Helper? ``Bart's Dog Gets a F''



Marge says the pet can stay if and only if he passes Obedience School.

At school, SLH refuses to roll over. Anticipating that the dog will flunk,

Homer composes a sale ad for SLH.



``Free to loving home. World's most brilliant dog. Says `I Love You'

on command.''

-- advertisement for selling Santa's Little Helper, ``Bart's Dog Gets an F''



Back to school, where Bart fails to impress Miss Winthrop.



Now... Sit!

I said, Sit! [Santa's Little Helper walks away]

Um, take a walk. Sniff that other dog's butt.

See? He does exactly what I tell him.

-- Bart trying to demonstrate his control over the dog,

``Bart's Dog Get an F''



Homer hardsells SLH to a guy on the phone. Back at school, SLH is unable

to restrain himself from consuming a Beef Wellington. A potential customer

comes by to inspect SLH. Bart fails to talk Miss Winthrop into letting

SLH pass, and balks at using the choke chain with the level of force that

Miss Winthrop prescribes. Lisa begins a new family quilt, its first panel

depicting the destruction of the old one. Bart despairs of training SLH,

and Lisa suggests they spend their last few hours together in play. In a

Lassie-style miracle, this bonding experience breaks down the

communication barrier between Bart and SLH. Bart successfully trains SLH.

Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Written by Jeff Martin

Directed by W. M. ``Bud'' Archer

Blackboard :- `I will not sell land in Florida'



Driveway :- no oil on the driveway.

Homer does not shake his fist at Bart.

Homer says D'oh! when Lisa scoots past.



Couch: :- The family all fit, with Maggie in Marge's 'do.



... baby Homer has <exactly> the same amount of hair as adult Homer?

... the director of the orphanage is Dr. Hibbert's twin brother?

... The advisor, when indicating the number six, held up all four fingers

on one hand and two on the other?

... the slogan for the Persephone was `THE MYTH BECOMES A LEGEND'?

... Maggie instinctively grabbed Herbert's necktie?

... Bart was cheating at Marco Polo? (See below.)

... Marge is wearing SHORTS on the boat? (Only the second time

the first being `There's No Disgrace Like Home')

... when Lisa and Bart are playing croquet, there is a butler standing

there? When Lisa makes her shot, she walks over and drinks a glass

of lemonade from the butler's tray. (Meanwhile, Lisa and Bart are

dressed in the most adorable outfits.)

... Maggie fell only once? (But it was well-timed.)



Dave Hall (dave@sys6626.bison.mb.ca)

... Marge is wearing Bunny slippers? (cf. Life In Hell)



Tucker

- unveiling a new car model.

Damn Yankees

- `Whatever Homer wants, Homer gets' cf `Whatever Lola Wants, Lola Gets'

+ The Godfather

- `As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother.'

Twins

- Danny DeVito playing a long-lost brother.

The Arnold Schwarzenegger spoof in `McBain' helped, too.



The game Marco Polo

The rules:



1. The player who is `it' keeps his eyes closed throughout.

2. When `it' yells `Marco!', everybody else must yell `Polo!'.

3. `It' must catch some other player while keeping his eyes closed.

4. Whoever `it' catches becomes the new `it'.

5. Players are not allowed to leave the pool. (Hence, Bart was cheating.)



A popular variation is to have a different rule 5:



5. Players may leave the pool.

6. If `it' thinks that somebody has left the pool, he can yell `Fish out

of water!' Then whoever left the pool becomes the new `it'.



It is clear that Bart and Lisa were playing by the original rules,

since Bart had an evil grin on his face as he tiptoed around the pool.



The nuclear power industry

The following article was posted by Chris Baird {cjb}:



The most heat, however, was generated by the show's constant use of

nuclear power as the butt of jokes. Homer Simpson works at the local

nuclear plant and, when saying grace at the dinner table, is wont to

say such things as: ``... and thank you Lord for nuclear power, which is

yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country''. Sam

Simon admits he is largely responsible for the often anti-nuclear gags

in the show, but says he is ``not on this mission against nuclear power;

I just think it's funny that a boob like Homer can have a job in such a

potentially dangerous situation.'' Still, he has managed to get both

sides of the nuclear debate offside. The episode in which a three-eyed

mutant fish is found by Bart and Lisa in the river near the plant, for

instance, caused quite a stir. ``It's funny, you know. I just try to

make the shows, and if people want to analyse them they can. I sat in a

college classroom where a professor was telling students that it was the

most pointed piece of political satire that had aired on prime-time

television in the last 10 years!'' Simon laughs. ``I co-wrote that

three-eyed fish episode and, honest to God, two of us sat in my office

for a couple of days and strung together some jokes. There was no point

to it.'' The fallout from the nuclear jokes was amusing, says Simon.

``I'm glad it's over, except I've ended up on some more mailing lists.''

So what happened? ``When the show started, the United States Council for

Energy Awareness, which is a fairly powerful nuclear power lobbying

group, said, `You're having fun at our expense. Why don't you come down

to a nuclear power plant and see what it's really like?' There's no way

that writers on this show would turn down a chance like that.



``It was a really fun field trip that taught us that, in some ways, our

show was unrealistic, but, in other ways, it was more realistic than we

would have ever thought possible. They got angry that we weren't

completely turned around by the field trip and that we didn't stop doing

jokes about nuclear power so they issued a press release stating how

upset they were. I was called by Associated Press and l essentially

said `I'm sorry they feel bad about it.' Then the anti-nuclear people

got upset because they don't want to hear anything but a complete

anti-nuclear agenda and they wanted equal time



``I said, `You want equal time because I'm not listening to these other

people?' '' Simon nearly breaks up with laughter. ``It doesn't make

sense!''



The moral to the story, Simon says, is ``that people on both sides of

that particular controversy don't have a sense of humour, and I'm glad

that I do. We're going to keep having fun with nuclear power on the

show.''



We watch the conclusion of a McBain movie, and Grampa and Jasper boo and

hiss when it ends.



Grampa: The screen was too small.

Jasper: The floor was sticky.

Grampa: The romantic subplot felt tacked-on.

Jasper: In short, we demand a refund.

-- Complaining at the movie theater, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



The clerk tells Grampa, ``Don't have a heart attack, old dude.''

And Grampa does. Meanwhile, it is dinnertime at the Simpson residence.



... and thank you most of all for nuclear power,

which has yet to cause a single proven fatality.

At least in this country. Amen.

-- Homer, saying grace, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



When Bart sneaks a bite of a green bean during the blessing, he and Lisa

get into an argument...



Quiet you kids. If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons,

and Lisa doesn't get to go to college.

-- Homer, threatening his kids, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



So Bart and Lisa resort to `pantomomime' to communicate. The dinner is

interrupted by a phone call from the hospital. Grampa had a mild heart

attack.



Grampa: Pull your chair closer, my son.

Homer: What is it, Dad?

Grampa: Peeyoo! Not that close! Sheesh.

Homer, that heart attack made me realize that I'm going to die

someday.

Homer: Oh, Dad, you and your imagination.

-- hospital visit, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Grampa tells Homer something he ought to know: He has a half-brother.

While he was courting Granma, Grampa went to the carnival to check out

the skirts...



Hey handsome, wanna `dunk' the `clown'?

-- Carnival girl/prostitute, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



She did things your mother would never do. Like have sex for money.

-- Grampa, remembering an affair, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



When the carnival returned to town a year later, the carnival girl had

a surprise for him... a baby boy. The baby was left at the Shelbyville

orphanage. When Granma gave birth to Homer...



Granma: Abe, I want Homer to grow up respecting his father.

He must never know about that, that carnival incident.

Grampa: Okay.

Granma: Promise you won't tell him.

Grampa: I promise.

[end of flashback]

Grampa: Oops! Forget what I just told you.

-- hospital visit, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer: This makes me special, Dad. Since I'm the one you kept, that

must mean you really loved me.

Grampa: Mm. Interesting theory.

-- hospital visit, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



In the car on the way home...



Lisa: A long-lost half-brother. How Dickensian!

Bart: So, any idea where this bastard lives?

Homer: Bart!

Bart: His parents aren't married are they?

It's the correct word, isn't it?

Homer: I guess he's got us there.

Marge: Mmm...

Bart: [singing]

Bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard bastard!

Marge: Bart!

Homer: Bart! Baart!

-- car ride, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer pays a visit to the Shelbyville Orphanage, to find that it is now

a gas station...



Homer: Oh brother, where art thou!

Attendant: Take it easy, buddy, they moved across the street.

Homer: Oh, hee hee. Sorry.

-- looking for the orphanage, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Inside...



Director: I know how you feel, Mr. Simpson.

I myself have spent years searching for <my> long-lost twin brother.

Homer: Yeah yeah yeah. Well, I wish I could help you, but we're looking

for <my> brother today.

-- visit to the orphanage, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Director: Your brother could be anywhere. Even ... Detroit.

Homer: I know he could be <anywhere>,

that's why I want you to narrow it down! Please!

Director: You know, Mr. Simpson, if you ask me, the city of <brotherly> love

isn't Philadelphia, it's ... Detroit.

Homer: Well, if you asked me, changing the subject makes you the

most worthless, heartless excuse for a human being I ever...

Director: Read between the lines, Mr. Simpson!

Homer: Oh, I get it! Okay. Here's twenty bucks. Now will you

tell me where my brother lives?

-- visit to the orphanage, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer finally learns his brother's name is Herbert Powell, and that he lives

in Detroit. Homer goes through a Detroit phone book...



Let's see. Powell, Powell, Powell...

Pomerantz, Poole, Popkins, Potter, Quigley, Quimby, Randal, oops, too far.

-- Homer, looking through the phone book, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer calls all three `Powell, Herbert's in the phone book, with no luck.

Marge suggests trying to call `H Powell', and he hits the jackpot.



Homer: Hello? Hello? Stupid phone! [bangs the phone]

Herbert: Hey, knock it off. I'm here!

I'm just silent because of the emotion involved.

Homer: Oh. Sorry.

-- first contact with his brother, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Herbert invites Homer to pay a visit...



Bart+Lisa: Are we there yet?

Homer: Just a little further!

Bart+Lisa: Are we there yet?

Homer: Just a little fur...

Bart+Lisa: Are we there yet?

Homer: Just a little further!!

Marge: Bart! Lisa! If you don't behave, we'll turn this car

right around and go home.

Homer: But Marge, I want to see my brother!

Marge: Oh, for God sakes, Homer, it's an empty threat.

-- car ride, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer gets pulled over for speeding, but the trooper apologizes. ``Sorry

sir, I didn't know it was you.'' Homer goes to a rest room, and a fellow

says, ``Wow! What are <you> doing here?'' The car hits a pothole, and Homer

spills his drink (D'oh!). Meanwhile, at Powell Motors...



Herbert: Every day we're losing ground to the Japanese and I want to know why.

Advisor: Oh, unfair trade practices?

Advisor: Mushy-headed one-worlders in Washington?

Advisor: Some sort of gypsy curse?

-- board meeting, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads!

-- Herbert Powell, board meeting, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Herbert: You, what are your roots?

Advisor: Well, I guess you could say they extend to when the Angles met

the Saxons... [all except Herbert chuckle]

Herbert: Or in other words, when white met bread.

-- board meeting, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer arrives at the Powell mansion, and Herbert steps out of his limo.

They greet each other emotionally.



Holy moly, the bastard's rich!

-- Homer, seeing his brother's mansion, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer introduces his family...



Homer: And our three children: Bart, Lisa ...

Maggie: [falls down] [thud]

Homer: ... and Maggie.

Bart: Hello, sir.

Lisa: Hello, Mr. Powell.

Herbert: All born in wedlock?

Homer: [whispers] Yeah, though the boy was a close call.

-- introducing his family, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Bart identifies himself as `the little hell-raiser', and Homer tosses

Maggie into Herbert's arms. (Maggie instinctively grabs Herbert's tie.)



Herbert: While you're here, I want you to make yourselves right at home.

Any time you're hungry, any time day or night,

Cook will make you anything you want.

Homer: Even pork chops?

Herbert: Absolutely. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool,

a screening room...

Homer: If I want pork chops any time in the middle of the night,

your guy will fry them up?

Herbert: Sure, that's what he's paid for.

Now, if you need towels, laundry, maids...

Homer: Wait, wait, wait. Lemme see if I got this straight.

It's Christmas Day, 4am, there's a rumble in my stomach...

Marge: Homer, please.

-- touring the estate, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



In the pool, Lisa and Bart play `Marco Polo'...



Herbert: So, Marge, a little about yourself.

Marge: Well, I met Homer in high school. We got married and had three

beautiful children.

Herbert: Wow. We have so much catching up to do.

Marge: Mm. Actually, I just told you pretty much everything.

-- poolside, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Bart: Watch me dive!

Lisa: Watch me dive!

Homer: OKAY, we're watching!

Marge: I hope we're not spoiling them...

[they dive]

Bart: Man, you weren't watching, I did a double gainer with a half...

Lisa: Hey, you didn't see what I did, you didn't watch me dive...

-- poolside, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer calls Grampa ...



A millionaire!? Ooh, I kept the wrong one.

-- Grampa learns of his long-lost son, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Grampa begs Homer, `Please, don't do anything stupid!' Herbert takes

Bart and Homer on a balloon ride.



Bart: Unkie Herb, can I spit over the side?

Herbert: Heh heh heh. I love this kid. Hock your brains out!

[Bart spits, as does Herbert]

Bart: Ho! Got him!

-- in a balloon, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



That evening, Homer makes a phone call from bed...



Hello, cook?

Sorry to bother you so late, but I got a hankering for some...

That's right. Don't forget the applesauce!

-- Homer, on the phone late at night, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Herbert takes Homer to his garage and offers him any car he wants. But

none of the cars is to Homer's liking. When he confronts his engineers,

they explain, ``Because Americans don't want'' cars like that. Herbert

hires Homer to design a car.



Herbert: And I want to pay you $200,000 a year!

Homer: And I want to let you!

-- hiring Homer as a consultant, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer is introduced to his team of engineers. Meanwhile, Lisa wants to

go on a pony ride, but Bart wants to go on a boat ride, so Herbert decides

to compromise: They go for a pony ride on a boat. At the plant,

the engineers shoo Homer away. Homer returns home...



Herbert: Hey Homer, how's your car coming?

Homer: Oh, fine. They were putting in an onboard something-or-other

and rack-and-peanut steering.

-- first day on the job, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Herbert: Do you understand?

Homer: Sort of.

Herbert: Homer?

Homer: What.

Herbert: Answer me again with self-confidence!

Homer: SORT OF!

-- pep talk, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Homer goes back to his team of engineers and tells them what he wants.

Like a place to put his drink. Not a little cup, but one of those

super-slurpers at the Kwik-E-Mart. And all sorts of other amazingly

tacky things...



Some things are so snazzy they never go out of style!

Like tail fins... And bubble domes... And shag carpeting...

-- Homer, designing a car, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



While Lisa and Bart are playing croquet, Herbert gets a call from his

lead engineer.



Hang up, call me back, and say the exact opposite of everything you just said.

-- Herbert, to his advisor, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



He then calls Lisa and Bart over and lets them listen to the engineer's

`modified' report. Homer continues to throw his weight around the lab...



I want a horn here, here, and here.

You can never find a horn when you're mad.

And they should all play `La Cucaracha'.

-- Homer, designing a car, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Advisor: What about a separate soundproof bubble-dome for the kids

with optional restraints and muzzles?

Homer: Bullseye!

-- designing a car, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



And Lisa and Bart introduce Herbert to the wonders of animated cartoons...



Lisa: The mouse is named Itchy and the cat is named Scratchy.

Bart: They hate each other.

Lisa: And they're not shy about expressing it.

-- ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



To think I wasted my life in boardrooms, and stockholders meetings,

when I could've been watching cartoons!

-- Herbert Powell, watching `Itchy and Scratchy'

``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



At the lab, Homer is hooked up with electrodes and is sent through

a wind tunnel. Meanwhile, Marge is concerned that Herbert is spoiling

the children.



Hello there. Do you miss the Antarctic?

-- Lisa, talking to a penguin at the zoo, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



When Homer is shown the plans for his car, he tears it up and draws

his own. The moment has come for the grand unveiling...



Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed stockholders,

members of the press, Your Holiness...

-- Herbert Powell, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



All my life, I have searched for a car that feels a certain way.

Powerful like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding like a Nerf ball.

Now, at last, I have found it.

-- Homer, describing his car, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



When Herbert learns the monstrosity costs $82,000, Herbert realizes he's

doomed. Homer gives the horn a honk, and it plays `La Cucaracha'.

Herbert's bags are packed as a crane replaces the `Powell Motors' sign

with `Kumatsu Motors'.



Homer: Gee Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all

your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you'd have been

better off if I'd never come into your life.

Herbert: Maybe I would have been better off?

MAYBE!

Why you sponge-head. Of COURSE I'd have been better off.

As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother!

Marge: Mm. Maybe he just said that to make conversation.

-- Herbert leaving forever, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



His life was an unbridled success until he found out... he was a Simpson.

-- Lisa, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''



Grampa arrives, then says, ``D'oh! I knew you'd blow it!'' On the ride

home, as the car leaves Michigan, Marge and the girls have dozed off...



Bart: Dad?

Homer: What is it, boy?

Bart: I thought your car was really cool.

Homer: Thanks boy! I was waiting for someone to say that.

-- driving home, ``Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?''

Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment Written by Steve Pepoon

Directed by Rich Moore

Blackboard :- `I will not make flatulent / noises in class'.

`I will not make flatule' at cutoff.



Driveway :- no oil on the driveway.

Homer does not shake his fist at Bart.

Homer says `D'oh!' when Lisa scoots past.



Couch: :- The family does a little dance.



... Ned said, `D'oh!'? [Bryant S Liu (bliu@cbnewsf.att.com)]

(Though it wasn't said in the same way.)

... the cable installer's pants were slung low, revealing his rear cleavage?

(A sketch based on this phenomenon got SNL into trouble. Ah, how

times have changed.)

... we hear a snippet from `Davey and Goliath'?

... Bart's hair was combed down and Lisa was wearing an adorable Sunday hat?

... Marge was wearing lipstick in the car on the way home from church?

(In some circles, wearing makeup to church is considered unethical.)

[Dave Hall (dave@sys6626.bison.mb.ca)]

... Dr. Nick Riviera reappears?

... a shopping cart was rolling out of the supermarket parking lot?

... Maggie is tossing things into the shopping cart? (And when Lisa

yells, `Thou shalt not steal!', Maggie drops a glass jar?)

... when Homer hears about `The bout to knock the other guy out',

he stands up in excitement, and Lisa (who had been seated on his knee)

falls to the floor as a result? (Poor Lisa.)

... while Homer is buying a Crate-O-Duff's at the Qwik-E-Mart, Jimbo

is in the background shoplifting? He was also shoplifting at the

supermarket.

... the signs in the store say `Eat more often' and `Buy and buy again'?

... Mr. Burns says, ``"Ah, Simpson, I was just in the neighborhood'' to

Barney? This is a new low in Burns' being unable to recognize his

employees. [Mike Dolny (6500poln%ucsbuxa@hub.ucsb.edu)]

... many assorted TV voices were supplied by Phil Hartman?

... the fight announcer is the same one from the golf tournament? [Jym Dyer]

... when Homer panics and collects the things he `borrowed' from work,

one of the things he hands to Bart is a computer? (Looks like a

monitor and keyboard.) {cjb}



Dave Hall's Maggie fall count:

1. When the family comes in with the groceries.

2. When walking towards the TV.

3. When Marge hands Lisa a glass of lemonade.

4. At the very end, when the family walks out onto the front yard to

watch Homer cut the cable. (It happens very fast and there's no

sound effect.)



North by Northwest

- Homer jumps in front of a truck to try to flag it down. {abw}

Mike Tyson, Buster Douglas, Don King

- Dreaderick Tatum (Mike Tyson) fights somebody (Buster Douglas)

who dedicated the bout to his late mother. Tatum's manager

has a Don King hairdo.

~ Gandhi

- Marge serves Lisa lemonade during her nonviolent protest. {jd}

(Gandhi drinks only lemonade [lemon in water] during his fast.)



Notable things on cable:

- Cable shopping channel, selling `poopsie the clown'.



- `Lemondade?' `Please.' from `Porch Pals'? This is the cartoon that

was created as a result of Marge's protest against cartoon violence

in `Itchy and Scratchy and Marge'. (The protest was in I&S&M, not

the violence.) Note also that the cartoon was cut for cable.



- `I used to be poor like you!' from Tommy Vu's real estate

program-length advertisements. [Dale Gass]



- The stand-up comedian who sounded a lot like Jerry Seinfeld.

[Ken Staggers]



What's the point?

st883045@pip.cc.brandeis.edu:



I think the message that MG was trying to convey is that cable will show just

about ANYTHING. "Porch Pals" was rejected by dozens (maybe hundreds) of kids,

but cable shows it. I don't think I need to say much about Tommy Vu.



BTW I freeze-framed the Top Hat channel and what I saw behind Homer's leg

was something that looked vaguely like two roman columns with a red curtain

hanging between them. Not too exciting.



Homer's TV habits

amehrer@misvax.mis.arizona.edu (Annette):



Watch the plant next to the couch during that scene. Marge had

brought the plant into the living room earlier in the show--it was just a

wee sprout. During the scene in question, the plant grows and grows and

then wilts and dies. This would indicate that the scene actually took

place over months, which is supported also by the deep imprint of Homer's

body on the couch when he (finally?) gets up.



rmm@hydra.ipac.caltech.edu (Mike Melnyk):



Clearly, the challenger, Dreaderick Tatum, is a caricature of Mike Tyson,



stx7226@uoft02.utoledo.edu (Janet Healey):



The other boxer (Watson) is obviously James "Buster" Douglas. He is the boxer

who whoopped Tyson's butt and then dedicated the fight to his mother who had

died two weeks (or so) before the fight.



jimi@cbnewsm.att.com (james.d.wynn):



Was Barney driving a Miata to Homer's house to watch the fight?

The vehicle was blue but not the Miata mild dark blue...BUT Barney's head

and the size of the interior were about the right ratio for it to be a Mazda.



staggers@casbah.acns.nwu.edu (Ken Staggers):



I thought this episode REALLY stood out because of the ACTING! Yes,

the acting..which translates into the director and the animators. The fact

that Homer's head was bobbing up and down with an incredible sarcastic grin

made the line "Nothing a month...yeah, I think we can swing that" HYSTERICAL.



Also, when they were showing the program length commercial, the lady on

stage had great body movement..which made her line sound SO phony (which is

the way everyone on plc's sound)



[And the scene change when Lisa turns her head, and the background dissolves

to the car on the way home. --rjc]



Did you notice Bart pushing his hair back up when he got back to the

couch to watch cable?



Chris Baird observes that, during the biblical flashback, if you

shaved off the beards and ignored the accents:



the carver of graven images ==> Rev. Lovejoy (maybe)

the adulterer ==> Jacques



The Carver's nose is different, so maybe there is no connection there.



And when Bart is showing the X-rated channel to his friends, the American spy

from 'Crepes of Wrath' was sitting next to Wendell.



David S. Berger (dsberger@pisces.rutgers.edu) carefully slo-mo'd the Simpsons

Shuffle, and here's what he reports:



Right after the Simpson's jumped on the couch the couch fell through the

floor! This only lasted one cartoon frame (1/24 or 1/30 sec ?). I watched

this scene one more time at normal speed, looking for evidence of the event,

but there was none. there was absolutely no evidence that this event ever

took place. To see this gag, you had to watch it with a VCR.



Dave Hall's astute eyes report...



In the opening scene, while Homer (the Thief) is talking to Azran (Carver of

Graven Images), a person behind Homer strikes another person down. (What

other sins were commited during this scene?) [I saw a man struggling with

a woman. --rjc]



The cable guy leaves his(?) ladder behind in Flanders yard.



The Cable guy's truck plate number is 1NBNW.



Santa's Little Helper (SLH) `sort of' glares at the cable guy's rear-end.



The T.V. depicted on the pamphlet appears to be the same T.V. shown in the

opening credits. (Even the Channel nobs are in the same position.)



The ``Hear Me Roar: Network for Women'' host wears knee-high boots.



While the family is watching T.V., Maggie and Snowball (II) are sleeping

on SLH.



While Homer's alone watching T.V., SLH appears to have a rather long nose.



Homer's pajama buttons are on the wrong side. (Tell me if I'm wrong, but

shouldn't buttons be on the right side of shirts/pajamas?) [Men's buttons

are on the right; women's on the left. Does this mean Homer is a

cross-dresser? --rjc]



When Homer gets ready for Church, he shoves the T.V. remote into the

couch, which appears later (when the family comes back) on the armrest.



In Sunday School, Milhouse appears to be the only kid not wearing socks.



The lady with the ``Madonna'' type hair-do just behind the cashier.



The ``Caution: Looking into laser...'' sign on the cash register. (I couldn't

read the rest.)



When Homer installed bars around the house, it appears that the Tree house

also has bars. (This is debatable.)



The "No Thieves" sign planted in the front yard.



In Homer's panic sequence, his prison number is 7734.

[Daniel S. Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu) brilliantly suggests that

you punch `7734' into a calculator and turn it upside-down.]



dattier@ddsw1.MCS.COM (David W. Tamkin):



The Douay Bible's numbering, followed by many Roman Catholics, skips

"Remember the Sabbath day" and divides "Thou shalt not covet" into two

parts to make ten again. For Catholics who follow the Douay enumeration,

"Thou shalt not steal" is seventh.



For other Christians and for Jews, "Thou shalt not steal" is eighth.



Groening is of Dutch ancestry, so it's not surprising that he used the

Protestant numbering.



Here are the most commonly-encountered Judaic, Protestant and Catholic

numberings. Note that the choice of words depends on what translation

you use. (Exodus 20:1--17 and Deuteronomy 5:6--21)



Jud. Prot. Cath.

==== ==== ====

1 1 1 I am the Lord your God.

2 " " Thou shalt have no other God before me.

" 2 " Thou shalt not make graven images.

3 3 2 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.

4 4 3 Remember to keep holy the Sabbath.

5 5 4 Honor thy Father and thy Mother.

6 6 5 Thou shalt not kill.

7 7 6 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

8 8 7 Thou shalt not steal.

9 9 8 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

10 10 9 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.

" " 10 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.



rsteele@xn.ll.mit.edu (Rob Steele):



I can't tell whether MG intends Miss Sunday School Teacher to be a heretic

but, for the record, she is. The orthodox answer to Martin's question about

how to avoid damnation is, roughly, believe the truth. That is, no one can

possibly obey the ten commandments well enough to deserve heaven but "God so

loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in

him should not perish, but have eternal life." (John 3:16)



This is not a controversial doctrine in most churches. It certainly would not

be in Springfield Vanilla Baptist or Punchclock Presbyterian. It would not be

suprising though to find a well-intentioned but misguided sunday school

teacher who believed in "salvation by works," ie., that integrity or some

particular act or level of obedience are what God requires.



MG ridicules many cultural phenomena and is clearly doing so in the character

of the sunday school teacher. But what phenomena precisely? I think it's

just small-town, old-time, middle-American moral do-goodyness, an easy target.

Lisa: But everybody does it.

I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak.

Homer: Oh. Look at this way, when you had breakfast this morning,

did you pay for it?

Lisa: No.

Homer: And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?

Lisa: No, I didn't.

invites the gang at Moe's tavern to watch the fight. He also invites Apu...

Homer: Bart!

Bart: Dad! [He didn't yell `Homer!']

so I am choosing not to watch it

in the hopes that others will follow my example.

refuses to part with it. So Marge suggests they pay for it, and Homer

explains, `Look, Marge, I can't afford it. when I can afford to pay for

it, I will, but I can't, so I'm not going to.' (Ah, the song of a pirate.)

Here, I brought some imported generic beer.

-- Barney brings a gift, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Apu: Oh, hello, Mrs. Homer. I brought an assortment of jerkys.

Homer: Oh, did you swipe those from work?

Apu: Certainly not. What has been implied here?

-- Apu arrives to watch the fight on Homer's stolen cable TV,

``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



The TV pre-fight hype replays an incident from earlier in the day.

Lisa quietly announces...



I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching

this fight as my form of nonviolent protest.

-- Lisa refuses to watch stolen cable,

``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



When Moe arrives, Homer frantically hides the mugs he swiped from

Moe's Tavern...



Hey, go protest outside, will ya? Now!

-- Homer yells at Lisa who simply stares at him,

``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



... before opening the door. Moe's gift is a mug from the tavern.

Homer then sees Burns and Smithers coming up the walk.



Homer: Quick, Bart! Hide the stuff I borrowed from work!

Bart: Borrowed?

Homer: All, right, that stuff I stole from work.

-- Panicking when Mr. Burns arrives, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Will you quit staring at me like that!?

-- Homer to Lisa who is staring innocently at Homer from outside,

``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Burns arrives and gives Homer `some munchies', a tiny bag of Cheetos.

Burns' appearance scares some of Homer's guests. The next visitors are

the two cops.



Cop: Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hookup.

Homer: No! No, I... It wasn't me. It was my wife. My wife's idea.

Yeah, yeah, ...

-- ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



... but they just want to watch the fight, too. Outside, Marge brings

Lisa some lemonade and moral support.



When you love somebody, you have to have faith that in the end,

they will do the right thing.

-- Marge to Lisa, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



The pre-fight hype profiles Dreaderick Tatum...



Announcer: The challenger learned how to fight in the notorious province[?]

of Capital City, and honed his skills while serving time for

aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.

Barney: Awright! A local boy!

Tatum: For five years, I was incarcerated, away from my family, and

the mothers [sic] of my children...

-- Watching the pre-fight hype, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Hearing the list of charges against Tatum gives Homer the willies, and

he envisions himself in jail, isolated from his family. (He calls,

``Marge! Lisa! Maggie!'' Bart is conspicuously missing.) As the

fight begins, he drags Bart outside.



I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know that

I've made a couple of really important decisions.

Number 1: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over, and

Number 2: I'm not very fond of any of you.

-- Homer, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Lisa: Dad, we may have saved your soul.

Announcer: [from the TV inside] Tatum is reeling from the champ's

exquisite hailing...

Homer: Yeah, at the worst possible time!

-- Cutting the cable hook-up, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Tatum wins the fight by knockout, and the guests file out.



Apu: What a donnybrook, eh, Mr. Burns?

Burns: Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett

fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen

rounds! Back then, of course, if the fight lasted less than

fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back!

-- After watching the big fight, ``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Later that evening, Homer takes the cable clippers and prepares to

climb the utility pole.



Dad, I beg you to reconsider.

Tractor pulls. Atlanta Braves baseball. Joe Franklin!

-- Bart begs Homer not to cut the cable hook-up,

``Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment''



Homer reaches the top, and cuts a wire. Half the lights in Springfield

go out. He cuts another wire, and the other half of the lights go out.

``Third time's a charm.'' Snip. Cut to static.

Shaft

My movie guide says that there were three ``Shaft'' movies



Shaft (1971) - A black private eye finds himself at odds with

a powerful racketeer.

Shaft's Big Score (1972) - Shaft avenges the death of a friend

and comes up against the numbers racket.

Shaft in Africa (1973) - Shaft is kidnapped by an Ethiopian emir who

wants him to track down a gang of slavers.



All three starred Richard Roundtree as the title character, and

the first one received an Academy Award nomination for musical score

and won an Academy Award for its title song. (Must've been a slow year.)



The guide also says that it spawned off a television series

and stimulated even more violent imitators.



Jym Dyer {jd}: "Shaft" was a blaxploitation movie like "Superfly." It was an

action-packed thang starring an ultra-hip black hero with an Afro.



Al Wesolowsky {abw}: They were based on novels by Ernest Tidyman, who wrote

several Shaft yarns. All are set in NYC, where Shaft is a private

detective. Tidyman was sort of a less-skilled version of Chester Himes.



The words

jthomas@ducvax.auburn.edu:



These lyrics are a transcription from the theme played during the opening

credits of the movie ``Shaft''. Issac Hayes wrote and performed the

soundtrack. Check out your local video store and sing along. Parentheses

indicate background singers.



Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine with all the chicks?

(SHAFT!)

Damn right!

Who is the man who would risk his neck for his brother man?

(SHAFT!)

Can you dig it?

Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?

(SHAFT!)

Right on.

They say this cat is a bad mother...

(SHUT YOUR MOUTH!)

I'm talking about Shaft.

(Then we can dig it.)

He's a complicated man but no one understands him but his woman.

(John Shaft!)



They don't write 'em like this anymore.



Homer's videotape for Maggie

Mike Killianey {mk}: If you look in the upper-left hand corner of the

screen, you'll notice a red dot flashing on and off beneath `REC'. I'm not

sure if there's any standard, but on my family's camcorder, this is a

warning to the user that the camera is paused, and nothing is being

recorded. So maybe Homer didn't get ANY of this on tape after all!



The (formal) dinner scene

agi@caen.engin.umich.edu (Andrew Isztwan):



Yes, you saw Bart's hair parted down the middle. It even looked a bit wavy.



connolly@wam.umd.edu (John. P. Connolly):



I think Bart looked very slick in the supper scene, in his spiffy suit.

But, he was still wearing his shorts. Has anyone seen a scene where

Bart wasn't wearing shorts (except when he is in his pajamas)?



The final scene

Freeze-frame addicts note that the bag says `Pork Rinos Light', though

the significance of this is unclear. And Jym Dyer points out that the

shopping list in <Simpsons Illustrated> spells it `Pork Rinds Lite'.



Anneliese Lilje suggests that perhaps the message is that living life to its

fullest for HOMER is sitting in front of the T.V. eating pork rinds...and that

may be sad to us but he looked pretty contented.



Richard Goehring reminds us that it's like the song says:



A big bag of pork rinds, gonna carry me to my grave...

-- Homer singing "Born under a Bad Sign"



The deadly blowfish

currmann@pnet51.orb.mn.org (Curtis Hoffmann):



It is fugu, a blow fish, that has the deadly nerve toxin in one of the

internal organs (either the liver of gall bladder, I forget which). There

are fugu restaurants in Japan, where the thrill of risking death by eating

even a slightly tainted sliver of meat is the whole point of the experience.



You must be a licensed fugu chef to work at such a restaurant, but there

are a number of "black market" fugu stands around, too.



However, fugu usually kills you within 15 minutes, not 24 hours. It starts

with a tingling in the fingers, and works its way up your arms and legs, until

you are completely paralyzed, and you die when it reaches your heart.



I'd guess that the fugu chef, and the doctor, were having a little fun at

Homer's expense.



Spage Yee {sy}: This fish is poisonous because its innards contain

tetratodoxin (TTX) which is a neurotoxin, which blocks either the sodium

or potassium (one or the other it's been a while since I studied

neurobiology) channels in your nervous system.



Michael T. Itamura refers the interested reader to the August 1984 issue of

National Geographic. Stories and photographs of the leopard puffer.

(Even a story about a famed Kabuki actor who ate the liver of the puffer

and paid for it with his life). Quite interesting.



Akira

Mark A. Holtz {mah} notes that Akira is one of the most popular

Anime/Japanese Animation films around.



Larry King

Paul Jeong {pj} attended a UCLA appearance of MG and Nancy Cartwright,

who mentioned that Larry King's role was first offered to Bruce

Springsteen, who turned it down. William Shatner also refused a guest

appearance (in an unspecified episode).



While Marge appears to be tossing a salad (though we see no greens),

Homer watches the microwave.



Homer: Is it done yet? Is it done yet?

Marge: Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer.

Homer: D'oh! Isn't there anything faster than a microwave?

-- Homer watches dinner cook, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Four... three... two... one... Bing! We have meatloaf!

-- Homer watches dinner cook in the microwave,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



``Get it while it's unbelievable hot, kids!'' The kids come in and

seat themselves for dinner.



I've got a dried-out end piece with your name on it, Lisa!

-- Homer serves dinner, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Hm. Thursday. Meatloaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be.

-- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer: What are you getting at?

Lisa: Well, you're always trying to teach me to be open-minded, try new

things, live life to the...

Homer: What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that!

-- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



[Notice that the concept of living life to its fullest reappears.]

Bart hands Homer the ketchup bottle. Marge thinks Lisa might be right.



Marge: Tomorrow night, it might be nice to go out for dinner.

Homer: Tomorrow night? Friday? Pork chop night? Marge! We haven't missed

pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87!

-- Marge suggests a change of pace, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Hm. Friday night. Pork chops. From cradle to grave, etched

in stone and God's library somewhere in heaven...

-- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer: Okay, okay, where do <you> want to go?

Lisa: Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza, or fried chicken!

Homer: Fine! We'll go to Mars!

-- Lisa muses on drab dinner fare, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Marge: Mm, there's that new sushi restaurant on Elm Street...

Bart: Sushi? Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on

the playground, but isn't that raw fish?

Lisa: As usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point

entirely.

-- Marge suggests the family go to a Japanese restaurant,

`One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



``Sushi is considered quite a delicacy,'' adds Lisa.



Marge: Please, Homer, can't we try it? [going to a sushi bar]

Homer: No.

Lisa: Please, Dad, this argument humiliates us both.

Homer: If I said `no' the first time, what makes you think I'm going to

say `yes' the second time?

Lisa: Nothing, but you may say `yes' the ninety-ninth time.

Homer: Oh? Try me.

Lisa: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Lisa: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Lisa: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Lisa: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Lisa: Please, Dad.

Homer: No.

Lisa: Please, Dad.

Homer: Oh, okay, okay.

-- If at first you don't succeed, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



The family go to the Happy Sumo restaurant and are startled when the

chefs yell at them in Japanese. The hostess explains they were merely

saying Hello. So Homer yells ``HELLO!'' back at them.



This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but soon it will be hopping

with drunken Japanese businessmen.

-- Restaurant hostess, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



The family are seated and their waiter Akira takes their order. Marge

asks, ``What would you recommend for a family that's not sure they

should be here?'' He suggests the `very nonthreatening' sushi samurai,

and Marge and Lisa order it.



Bart: Akira, my good man, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.

Akira: Very good.

Bart: Do you have any giant squid? The kind that drags men to their deaths?

Akira: Not today.

-- At the Japanese restaurant, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer has trouble choosing. ``All looks so terrible.'' He places his

order. The Master Chef demonstrates his technique and scolds his

apprentice. ``Hang your head in shame.'' The dishes are brought, and

Homer loves it.

In the karaoke bar, a gentleman introduces himself. ``Hi, my name is

Richie Sakai. I'm an anaesthesiologist, and I'd like to dedicate this

next song to my wife, Patti.'' He proceeds to sing.

Homer eagerly places his next order. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa sing `Shaft'

in the karaoke bar. Homer looks for something he hasn't tried yet and

orders fugu. Akira tries to talk Homer out of it, to no avail.



Come on, pal! Fugu me!

-- Homer snaps at Akira the waiter, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



The kids continue their singing. The Master Chef hears a car horn. ``Ah,

she's here. Cover for me.'' After the Master Chef leaves, Akira places

the fugu order, and the apprentice decides that the preparation of fugu

should be left to the Master, since one wrong slice and the result is

fatally poisonous. The apprentice pays a visit to the parking lot.



Apprentice: But master, we need your skilled hands.

Master chef: My skilled hands are busy!

-- The master chef making the pretzel with Mrs. Krabappel,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



The apprentice chef studies the chart and carefully prepares the fugu.



Fan-fugu-tastic!

-- Homer eats some fugu, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



The Master Chef returns and finds the blowfish on the cutting table.

Akira, the apprentice chef, and the Master Chef frantically yell in

Japanese to Homer. (``Beautiful language, isn't it Marge?'')

The apprentice chef tells Homer he may have been poisoned.



No need to panic. There is a map to the hospital on the back of the menu.

-- Apprentice chef at the Japanese restaurant,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



At the hospital, Homer sits on an examining table in his underwear,

and Dr. Hibbert and Marge come in. Homer takes a look at Marge's

sad demeanor and concludes, ``Ooh! It's good news, isn't it!'' But

it isn't.



Dr. H: You have twenty-four hours to live.

Homer: Twenty-four hours!

Dr. H: Well, twenty-two. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.

-- Homer learns he's going to die, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer embraces Marge.



Well, if there's one consolation, it's that you will feel no pain at all

until some time tomorrow evening, when your heart suddenly explodes.

-- Dr. Hibbert explains the consequences of eating tainted fugu,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Dr. H: Now, a little death anxiety is normal. You can expect to go through

five stages. The first is denial.

Homer: No way! Because I'm not dying! [hugs Marge]

Dr. H: The second is anger.

Homer: Why you little! [steps towards Dr. H]

Dr. H: After that comes fear.

Homer: What's after fear? What's after fear? [cringes]

Dr. H: Bargaining.

Homer: Doc, you gotta get me out of this! I'll make it worth your while!

Dr. H: Finally, acceptance.

Homer: Well, we all gotta go sometime.

Dr. H: Mr. Simpson, your progress astounds me.

-- Homer learns he's going to die, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



He leaves Homer a pamphlet, ``So You're Going to Die.''

[End of Act One. Time: 7:18]

That evening in bed, Homer decides not to tell the kids and shows Marge

the list of things he wants to do on his final day. He asks Marge,

``What's that word you use for when you and I, you know...'' Marge asks,

``When we're intimate?'' Homer adds ``Be intamit [sic] with Marge'' to

his list. Marge suggests they also get up early and watch the sunrise.

Homer kisses Marge good-night.

At 6:00am, the alarm clock goes off, and Homer shuts it off.

Homer finally wakes up at 11:30am. He rushes downstairs.



Homer: Marge! Why did you let me sleep so late?

Marge: You looked so peaceful lying there.

Homer: There'll be plenty of time for that!

-- Homer oversleeps to begin his final day on this earth,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



He consults his list. ``Have man-to-man with Bart.'' Homer comes into

Bart's room. ``Come here, boy.'' ``Oh, man,'' complains Bart, as he

drops his pants for a spanking. But that's not what Homer came in for.

He tells Bart that (after Homer) he's the man of the house, and Bart

whines, ``Lisa never lifts a finger, why don't you go yell at her!''

Homer tells Bart, ``This is <good> stuff!''



I want to share something with you:

The three little sentences that will get you through life.

Number 1: [whispers] Cover for me.

Number 2: Oh, good idea, Boss!

Number 3: It was like that when I got here.

-- Homer tells Bart the secret, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



``Hey, this <is> good stuff.'' Homer drags Bart into the bathroom

to teach him to shave. Bart's face is lathered as he watches Homer

finish with ``the little spot under your nose.''



Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares,

and stick one there... and there... and any place you're bleeding...

there... and there... Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on

your face.

-- Homer teaches Bart how to shave, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Next comes the after-shave. Homer slaps it on and screams in pain.

``Ooh, ahh, eeh, yaaargh! Rrrrrr. Ooh, yargh! You son-of-a-ohhh! Eee!''

``And that's how we shave.'' Bart accidentally knocks over the

after shave. ``Why you little!'' Bart quickly says, ``It was like

that when I got here!'' Homer embraces him. ``Oh, that's my boy!''

Next on the list is listening to Lisa play her sax. Homer comes into

Lisa's room, and she offers to stop playing. Homer asks her to continue.

Though confused, she does so. Homer cries at her melancholy music, but

her tune changes to something more upbeat, and Homer sings and dances.



Oh I want to be in that rumba

When the saints go over there!

-- Homer sings to Lisa's sax playing,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Next is, ``Make videotape for Maggie.'' Homer pays a visit to Ned Flanders.



Ned: Simpson, what a pleasant surprise. We were just pulling taffy.

Homer: Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it.

Ned: Heh heh, no sirree-bob!

-- Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, and Ned invites Homer's family over for

a barbecue tomrrow. Homer declines, then reconsiders...



Homer: I'll even bring the thickest juciest T-bones you've ever seen.

Ned: Mm mm. Sounds terrif!

Homer: Heh, the joke's on him! I'll be dead by then!

-- Ned invites Homer over for a cookout,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



At home, Homer sets up the camera and begins recording.



Ahem. This is a videotape for my daughter Maggie. Hi, Maggie! I'm

speaking to you from beyond the grave. Woooooooo! Hee hee hee, hope

that didn't scare you. Well, Maggie, you're grown-up now, and unless

you taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man

your father was. He was a simple man, a kind man, a gentle man who

loved his children and... [phone rings] D'oh! [answers] Hello!

Yeah, he's here, who is this? [scratches his butt] ... Bart's friend

Milhouse? Bart! Get your butt down here!

-- Homer tries to make a tape for Maggie,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



The next item is ``Make peace with Dad''. Homer pays a visit to Grampa

at the Retirement Home.



Homer: Dad, we've never been too close, have we.

Grampa: Not to my knowledge.

Homer: Never once went fishing or played catch or even hugged each other.

Grampa: We never danced the hootchie-koo, either. Whatcher point?

-- Homer reconciles with his father,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer tells Grampa he loves him, and the two embrace. Homer says he

has to go, but Grampa insists they've got a lot of catching up to do.

Grampa prevails on Homer to go fishing; later, they play catch and

wrestle. (While doing these things, Homer crosses things off his list

he no longer has time to do.) Homer finally pulls himself away as

Grampa presses his face against the car window. ``I love you, son!''

Mumbles Homer, ``Gee, the old guy's a little love-starved.''

Hoping to make up for lost time, Homer puts the pedal to the metal,

but gets pulled over. He tells the two cops to give him a ticket,

but they don't take kindly to being ordered around and throw him

into the slammer.

[End of Act Two. Time: 14:10]



Homer: [spots his harmonica-playing cell-mate]

That's sort of nice. What are you in for?

Man: Atmosphere.

-- Homer lands in jail, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer can't bear to use his one phone call to call Marge, so he calls

Barney. But he gets an answering machine. Homer leaves an angry

message, and we see that Barney is home, clipping his toenails. Barney

quickly picks up.



Homer: [on the phone] You gotta help me, Barney, I'm in jail.

Barney: You are? Hey, Homer, go to the window.

[waves across the street to Homer]

Hiya neighbor! I can see you!

-- Homer lands in jail, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer tells Barney to bring $50 for bail. (``Whadja do, kill a judge?'')

Barney hunts around his room to scrounge up $50. He also finds a slice

of pizza. Meanwhile, at home, Marge stares out the front window.



Bart: Why are we all dressed up?

Marge: [staring out the window waiting for Homer]

Because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner.

Lisa: Why are we using the good china?

Marge: Because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.

Bart: What's with the candles?

Marge: Sometimes it's fun to use candles.

Lisa: Why are we waiting for Dad?

Marge: Because we love your father and enjoy his company.

Bart: Why are we <really> waiting for Dad?

-- Homer is late for the last dinner of his life,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Chief Wiggum counts up the bail money. (``We don't usually take rusty

money.'') Barney drives Homer home and is crushed that Homer isn't

going to have one last drink with his buddies. Homer tries to explain

that there simply wasn't time. He then spots Burns.



Burns: [peering through binoculars]

Smithers! Check out the luscious pair on that redhead.

[staring at her red pumps]

That's it baby, work those ankles!

Smithers: Ring-a-ding-ding, sir.

-- ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer: Hey Burns! Eat! my! shorts!

Burns: Who the Sam Hill was that?

Smithers: Why it's Homer Simpson, sir. One of the schmos from sector 7-G.

Burns: Simpson, eh?

-- ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



(`Sam Hill' is an old euphemism for `hell'.) Burns demands to have

Simpson report to his office at 9 o'clock Monday morning. Barney

cajoles Homer into stopping by Moe's. Homer goes to a pay phone

to call Marge. Meanwhile, the bar phone rings.



Moe: Hello, Moe's Tavern. Birthplace of the Rob Roy.

Bart: Is Seymour there? Last name Butz.

Moe: Just a sec. Hey, is there a Butz here? A Seymour Butz?

Hey, everybody, I wanna Seymour Butz! [realizes] Wait a minute...

Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket! When I get my

hands on you, I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew!

-- Yet another phone prank, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer found that the line was busy.



Moe, another last beer, please.

-- Homer, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer tries to talk, but can't find the words. He kisses the bar denizens.



Moe: Please, not in public.

Man: You <better> be dying!

Barney: Whoa! How European! [belch]

-- responses from the bar folk to Homer's good-bye kisses,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer tells Barney to drive him home. Barney changes a flat tire, and

Homer can't wait any longer, so he gets out of the car and runs home.

He arrives home and bangs on the front window. ``Maaaarge! Maaaarge!''

Marge lets him in, and he quickly kisses the kids and dashes upstairs.

Marge is naked in bed as Homer gargles in the bathroom. She reads him

a poem she wrote.



Marge: I wrote a poem for you this afternoon, Homer. It's called,

`To a Husband'.

Homer: Okay, okay.

Marge: (Ahem.) The blackened clouds are forming.

Homer: Oh, give me a break, Marge.

Marge: Soon the rain will fall.

My dear one is departing.

But first, please heed this call.

That always will I love you,

My one, my love, my all.

-- ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer is touched.

In the middle of the night, Homer wakes up and tucks in the kids.



Goodbye, Maggie. Stay as sweet as you are.

Goodbye, Lisa. I know you'll make me proud.

Goodbye, Bart. ... I like your sheets.

-- Homer tucks in his children one last time,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



He goes downstairs and finds a Bible-on-cassette.



Hi, I'm Larry King.

In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth...

-- Bible-on-cassette, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer fast-forwards over all the `begets'.



... lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.

Well, that's it. Old Fred [?] is standing by, we'll get some coffee,

we'll get some matzo-ball soup. I love the San Antonio Spurs,

by the way, if you're betting on the NBA this year, I think they'll

win it all. So I guess there's nothing more to say but... [closing music]

-- Bible-on-cassette, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer's body goes limp. A bell tolls.

Marge wakes up the next morning to find Homer missing from bed. She

wanders downstairs and finds Homer's limp body slumped in his chair. She

finds drool on his lip, still warm. She wakes up Homer. ``You're alive!''

Grumbles Homer, ``What are you talking about?'' Then he realizes... He's

alive!



I'm alive! From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!

-- Homer realizes he's not dead after all,

``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''



Homer is planted on the couch, munching on pork rinds, and watching

bowling on TV. The credits go up silently over Homer's TV-watching.

[End of Act Three. Time: 21:54]

Driveway

Homer says nothing when Lisa scoots past.

Homer yells ``Auuuugh!'' when the car closes in on him.



Couch

Homer bumps everybody off the couch.





While skateboarding recklessly, Bart gets hit by Mr. Burns' car.



Smithers: I think the boy is hurt.

Burns: Oh for crying out loud, just give him a nickel and let's get going.

-- after... ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Bart's spirit rises from his body...



Hey, cool, I'm dead.

-- Bart realizes he's dead, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



and he takes an escalator to the pearly gates, seeing Great Grampa Simpson

and a tire-track-marked Snowball on the way. A voice instructs...



Please hold onto the handrail. Do not spit over the side.

[and repeated in Spanish]

-- Heavenly voice, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Bart spits over the side, and Bart falls down, down, down... as the voice

chides, `We told you to hold onto the handrail. We asked you not to spit

over the side'. Bart finds himself in the Underworld.



I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?

-- Bart introduces himself to Satan, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



But there seems to have been a mistake...



According to this, you're not due to arrive until the Yankees

wins the pennant. That's nearly a century from now.

-- The Devil, on Bart's premature visit to Hell, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Boy is my face red.

-- Satan after realizing Bart isn't due to arrive yet,

``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Bart: Um, say, is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?

Satan: Oh, sure, yeah. But, eh, you wouldn't like it.

Bart: Oh, okay! See you later, then.

-- Bart leaves Hell, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Satan: Remember: Lie, cheat, steal, and listen to heavy metal music!

Bart: Yes, sir!

-- Some parting advice, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Bart ascends to the world of the living and wakes up in a hospital room.

The family is joined by ...



Hutz: Hutz is the name, Mr. Simpson. Lionel Hutz, attorney at law.

Here's my card. It turns into a sponge when you put it in water.

Homer: Ooh, classy.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Homer: The doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe,

nothing serious.

Hutz: Pfft. Doctors. Doctors are idiots!

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Lisa: Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?

Hutz: How does a nice little girl like you know a big word like that?

-- Lisa suspects Lionel Hutz isn't on the level, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Marge asks Hutz to leave, and he does...



Lionel Hutz, attorney-at-law. What's that, a broken neck? Great!

-- Chasing a gurney down the corridor, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Dr. Hibert comes in...



Marge: Is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?

Hibert: Mm, better let him rest up a while first.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Homer talks to his coworkers about what happened...



Homer: If I wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr. Burns' office

right now and...

Smithers: Simpson!

Homer: Aah!

Smithers: Mr. Burns wants you to march into his office right now!

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Ah, Simpson. At last we meet.

-- Mr. Burns, calling Homer in regarding Bart's accident,

``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



when Burns offers him only $100, Homer notes that this hardly even covers

the medical bills. Burns accuses Homer of extortion and tosses him out.



Burns: Throw him out, Smithers!

Homer: You don't have to do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw <myself> out.

-- Burns tells Homer he isn't going to get a cent,

``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Homer wipes his brow with the Hutz sponge and decides to pay him a visit.



The Supreme Court called again. They need your help on some freedom thing.

-- Della, Lionel Hutz' secretary, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Yes, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, The Sorbonne, the Louvre [pron. Loove-rah].

-- Lionel Hutz, attorney at law, listing his degrees,

``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Mr. Simpson, the state bar forbids me from promising you a big cash settlement.

But just between you and me, I promise you a big cash settlement.

-- Lionel Hutz, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



You'll be getting more than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson.

You'll also be getting this exquisite faux pearl necklace,

a $99 value, as our gift to you.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



When Hutz says he's looking at $1 million, Homer is pleased. They go

to see Nick Riviera, so-called doctor.



Just look at the X-rays! You see that dark spot there? Whiplash.

And this smudge here, that looks like my fingerprint? No, that's trauma!

-- `Doctor' Nick Riviera, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Marge raises her objections...



With all due respect, Mrs. Simpson, you're not a doctor, the boy's

not a doctor, the only person who even comes CLOSE is this man [Nick Riviera].

-- Lionel Hutz responding to Marge's skepticism, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Hutz: Doctor, are you sure there isn't a little soft tissue trauma

in the facial area?

Riviera: Oh yeah, tons of it! [wrapping Bart's head] Just say when!

-- Bart is in the care of trained professionals, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Burns wants to fire Homer, but Smithers fears the headlines... Burns

dreams of headlines like ``Burns fires ungrateful employee'', ``Another

smart move by Burns'', and ``Hooray for Burns!'' Burns agrees to sit

and wait until the media have forgotten about the incident. Meanwhile,

Hutz rehearses Bart's testimony, as Marge's and Lisa's objections are

ignored. In court...



I should be able to run over as many kids as I want!

-- In court, Mr. Burns justifies his actions, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Judge: Mr. Burns, I must warn you that if you continue to disrupt the court

in this way, I will have to cite you for contempt.

Burns: You wouldn't dare!

Judge: Well, no, um, I guess I wouldn't.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Bart is wheeled to the witness stand.



Judge: Hello, Bart. Now, you do understand the difference between

telling the truth and telling a lie, don't you son?

Bart: Maybe.

Judge: Uh huh. Well, you wouldn't lie to the United States, would you, Bart?

Homer and Hutz: [prompting, whispering] No! No!

Bart: No.

-- Bart takes the witness stand, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Bart tells what happened. He was playing in his innocent childlike way,

when...



Defenseless child at three o'clock.

-- Smithers spying a helpless Bart in the street, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



``Luckily, I was not killed that day. Though sometimes [sob] I wish I

had been. [sniff]''



Marge and Lisa: Mmm...

-- Reactings to Bart's ``Believable testimony'', ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Then Burns takes the stand.



Oh, it was a beautiful day. The sun was shining.

I was driving to the orphanage to pass out toys...

-- Mr. Burns' view of events, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



But Bart evilly skateboards into his VW bug...



NOOOOOOOO!! TAKE ME!! I'M OLD!!

-- Mr. Burns' view of events, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



The jury are not convinced. During the recess...



Hang your heads in shame, you overpriced, underbrained glorified notary

publics! Just get that big ape to my house tonight and we'll buy him off

with a banana or two!

-- Mr. Burns bawling out his attorneys, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



David Tamkin notes: He must truly have been agitated. Normally he would

know that the plural of attorney is "overpriced, underbrained glorified

notaries public."

Marge and Homer are invited to the Burns mansion...



Burns: And that ugly customer was the last Indonesian rhino on earth.

Marge: Hm, I didn't know you liked animals.

Burns: Oh, I don't like everything about them. Just their heads.

-- Invited to the Burns mansion, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Homer: Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?

Burns: Yes.

-- A brief moment of honesty from Monty Burns, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Burns offers a $500,000 settlement and leaves Homer and Marge alone

to talk it over. Burns and Smithers spy on them as Homer wants to

hold out for the $1 million, but Marge fears what Homer has turned into,

what with shifty lawyers and phony doctors... Burns returns.



Sorry, offer's expired, I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide,

twelve good men and true, Smithers release the hounds.

-- Mr. Burns realizes that Bart made up his story, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Homer and Marge run across the lawn, chased by dogs. In court, Marge

is called to the stand by Burns' lawyer.



Bailiff: Do you promise to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing

but the truth, so help you God?

Marge: Mmm... Yes, I do.

Hutz: She sounded like she was taking that awful seriously.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Marge's honest testimony destroys Hutz's case.



Burns: I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper. It's not quite

as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair.

[draws a giant zero]

Hutz: I think we should take it.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



At the Simpson dinner table...



Homer: [thinks] A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.

Marge: Homer? Would you like some more macaroni and cheese?

Homer: [thinks] Yeah, a million dollars' worth, you treacherous

snake-woman! [out loud] No, thank you.

Marge: Some string beans?

Homer: [thinks] No, I don't want any string beans either, you two-timing

back-stabbing... Uh oh, better answer. [out loud] No, thank you.

Marge: Some celery with cream cheese on it?

Homer: [thinks] Just mouth polite nothings. [out loud] No, thank you.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Bart talks about what they could've gotten with the $1 million, and Homer

excuses himself to go over to Moe's. Marge's women's intuition tells her

something. At Moe's...



Moe: Oh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're

born to the day they die, they <think> they're happy, but trust me.

They ain't.

Homer: [thinks] Moe. Wish he'd shut up.

-- Homer drowns his sorrows in beer after losing a $1 million court case,

``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Marge arrives...



Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.

-- Marge, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Homer: [thinks to himself] She's been your wife for ten years, you've had

three children together, it's time to be honest with her.

[out loud] I'm not sure I love you any more.

Marge: Gasp!

Homer: But, don't worry. Uh, I'll never let on. I'll still do all the

bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.

-- ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Marge asks Homer to look her in the eyes and decide whether

or not he loves her. Homer starts with the feet...



All right, all right. Look at her if it'll shut her up.

Start with the feet. Still angry. Good! Good, Homer, good!

-- Homer's love for Marge is shaken, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Ah, good ol' trustworthy beer. My love for <you> will never die.

-- Homer's love for Marge is shaken, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''



Homer looks her in the eye and says, ``Oh, who am I kidding? I love you

more than ever!'' The bar gang cheer...



Okay everybody, for the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher.

One per customer, domestic beer only. Hey, no sharing.

-- Moe, ``Bart Gets Hit by a Car''

... nary two seconds after we see `Bart Gets Hit by a Car',

Bart gets hit by a car?

... the Devil is using a windowing interface to his computer?

... when Homer is called into Mr. Burns' office (the first time),

there is a line of attorneys standing next to Burns' desk,

and at the end of the line is a stuffed mounted polar bear?

... Della is reading `Popular Secretary'?

... when Burns and Smithers spy on Marge and Homer through the painting,

Burns looks through the eyes of a portrait of Mr. Burns, and

Smithers bends over to look through the eyes of Burns' dog?

[I'll leave the `bends over' part to the people who like to

argue about whether Mr. Burns is a Homer-sexual.]

... Doctor Julius Hibert went to Johns Hopkins?

... when Hutz buries his head in his hands after Marge ruins his case,

there are crumpled up pieces of paper and a broken pencil on the

table in front of him?



[John Kupec]

... one of the stores in opening scene is named `Cloth Store'?

... Burn's limo has an atom hood ornament?

... green goo dripping all over the nuclear power plant?

... Hutz's secretary's name is Della as in Perry Mason?



[Thomas Skrobala]

... that Judge Moulton looked a lot like non-Supreme-Court-justice

Robert Bork?



Also, when Burns' attorney asked Marge for her opinion of Dr. Riviera,

notice that Lionel Hutz didn't raise any objection? It seems he

didn't learn much about law at the Louvre Law School...



Some people note that Homer indignantly turns down Burns's offer of $500,000

even though that's what he would've gotten if he had won the lawsuit once he

paid Hutz's 50% fee. But Hutz probably would have claimed 50% of the $500,000

settlement, leaving Homer with $250,000.



~ A Tale of Two Cities

- After hitting Bart, Burns says, ``Just give him a nickel

and let's get going.'' In the book, the Marquis St. Evremonde

runs over a boy in the street and just tosses the father a coin.

Gaspard (the father) refused the coin and instead murdered the

Marquis. Wonder if Burns knew... {jdlb}

+ Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516), `Garden of Earthly Delights'

- the rendition of Hell

+ Rolling Stones, `Sympathy for the Devil'

- Satan says, `Please allow me to introduce myself.'

+ Wizard of Oz

- Bart waking up from his `dream' saying `And you were there,

and you and you...'

+ Miracle on 34th Street

- Judge asking Bart if he knows the difference between telling

the truth and telling a lie.

? Some as-yet unidentified movie ?

- Burns cradling Bart's head in his lap (in the Burns version)

and the camera pulling upward with a crowd of people surrounding

him.

Guesses include

- The Last Picture Show, when the poolroom owner's adopted son

gets tagged by a semi while sweeping the street. {rc}

- The Pulitzer-Prize-winning photo of the Kent State Massacre

of May 1970.

- Colors, when Robert Duvall is shot. {sy}

- The Human Comedy, ``check it out if you don't believe me'' {sf}

- Potemkin, when the mother holds her dead child {jev}

- Rebel Without a Cause, ``I'm pretty sure'' {ja}

- Romeo and Juliet, the final scene {din}

- West Side Story, the final scene {din}

- Superman, when Superman finds Lois Lane dead {sp}

- Twilight Zone, `In Praise of Pip', when Jack Klugman

prays for his son, he says something like ``Take me,

I'm old.'' {wb}

and probably the best guess

- Darby O'Gill and the Little People (Sean Connery)

Towards the end of the movie, old man Darby's daughter disobeys

her father's commands and goes up a mountain after a horse (storm

coming). She trips over a ledge and is knocked unconsious.

Fearing the Banshee curse placed on Darby will claim another

victim, he races after her and finds her lying on the ground.

Cradling her head in his lap, and with the camera pulling back,

yells out at the approching banshee ``Go away! Take me I'm

old!'' Darby throws a lantern at the hag, who disappears, then

he and her boyfriend (Connery) carry her back home.

{cjb's brother}



Several people have pointed out that the rendition of Hell is taken

Bosch's ``Garden of Earthly Delights''



As to what computer system the devil was using, my careful scrutiny

reveals it to be a Macintosh flavor. Note the menu bar across the

top of the screen instead of at the top of each window.



Note also the devil was right-handed. So much for `sinister'

intentions...



+ Bart passes through earth with dinosaur fossils embedded in it.



+ The Flanderses were getting booster shots on the ground floor of the

hospital; how typically responsible of them. [David Tamkin]



+ the sign on the door reads `State Booster Program'. [Joe Kincaid]



+ The syringe you see is not a real syringe, but rather is part of the

inoculation poster. [Thomas C. Allard]



+ The sign on the door reads `Authorized Personnel Only'. [Jeffrey R Carden]



+ Jacques is seeing his proctologist, probably more out of need than

Flanders-like prevention. [David Tamkin]



+ Bart passes by a room where a body with a toe tag lies in bed.



[David Tamkin]



Hutz's sponge card (a degree from the Louvre?) tells us to dial KL 5-LAWW;

he's been clogging our courts since 1974. [1976, actually. --rjc]



[David Tamkin]



The block from Hutz's office to Riviera's had ``(Something) Nook'' on the

corner, then ``[Your?] Law Offices of Lionel Hutz,'' then ``Gum for Less,''

[which Joe Kincaid points out is a new low in niche marketing] and

finally ``Dr. Nick Riviera, general specialist credit doctor.'' Signs in

Riviera's office windows read ``Yes, we're open'' and ``Yes, we use

anesthetic.'' How reassuring.



Riviera's degrees read ``Mayo Clinic Correspondence School,'' ``Club Med

School,'' ``Female Body Inspector,'' (how about ``Female Body Impersonator''?),

and ``I went to medical school for four years and all I got was this lousy

diploma.'' But as Hutz said, Riviera was the only person in the room who

even came close to being a doctor.



From: jasmerb@prism.cs.orst.edu (Bryce Jasmer)



Burns driving in that pink VW Bug with purple flowers. I think it was the

music that really made it great.



[dattier@ddsw1.MCS.COM (David W. Tamkin) and jwk@Scripps.EDU (John Kupec)

confirm that the music was "Tijuana Taxi" by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass.]



Lisa has but five lines in the entire episode (sigh):



1) Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?

2) Hello, Dr. Hibbert.

3) Dad, may I please make an observation?

4) I think this is all a charade to make Bart look

more injured than he really is.

5) Mmm.

Itchy and Scratchy and Marge

Driveway

Homer says nothing when Lisa scoots past.



Couch

The couch is missing.





Homer sees Marge making pork chops...



Marge: [making pork chops]

A dash of rosemary, a smidgen of thyme, a pinch of marjoram...

Homer: You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world.

Marge: Oh, Homer, they're nothing special. The extra ingredient is care.

[continues her work]

A sprinkle of chervil, a teaspoon of tumeric, and a whisper of MSG.

-- How much care am I supposed to add? ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



... and offers to build her a spice rack.



Homer: Marge, I'm going to build you a spice rack.

Marge: Oh, you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.

Homer: It's no trouble! I got a whole <garage> of tools I never use!

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Meanwhile, the kids watch an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon on the Krusty

the Klown show. Downstairs, Homer sets to work...



Ah, here it is. The complete handyman's bookshelf. Volume 1: Spice racks.

-- Homer sets to work to build a spice rack, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Homer produces a clump of wood and nails whose resemblance to a spice

rack is tenuous at best. Maggie appears and clonks Homer on the head

with a mallet. Upstairs, Homer's head is bandaged...



Bart: Hey Dad, can you move your head?

Homer: No, I can't. It's broken...

-- Is it in a cast? ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge sees the I&S cartoon and concludes that was the cause of Maggie's

actions.



Maggie: [picks up a pencil] [wacko `Psycho' music plays]

Homer: Aaaaaaaaagh!

Marge: [picks up Maggie] No, Maggie, bad baby!

Homer: Keep her away from me, Marge!

She's got that crazy look in her eyes again!

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



She forbids the kids from watching the cartoons.



Marge: You won't be watching these cartoons any more. Ever.

Lisa: But Mom, if you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense

of humor and be robots.

Bart: Really? What kind of robots?

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Milhouse invites Bart to watch I&S at his house. Meanwhile, Homer phones

in sick...



You heard me, I won't be in for the rest of the week. ...

I told you! My baby beat me up! ...

No, it is not the worst excuse I ever thought up. ...

[sotto voce] Wise guy.

-- Homer phones in sick after, well, you know, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge wonders why Bart and Lisa are so late from school (because they're

watching I&S with Milhouse and Janie, respectively). At the Simpsons

residence, Marge watches I&S and takes careful notes.



Marge: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

Homer: [laughs]

Marge: Mm...

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge decides to write a letter.



Dear purveyors of senseless violence:

I know this may sound silly at first, but I believe that the cartoons you

show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way.

Please try to tone down the psychotic violence in your otherwise fine

programming. Yours truly, Marge Simpson.

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Mr. Meyers sends back his reply...



Meyers: Take a letter, Miss White.

Dear valued viewer, thank you for taking an interest in the Itchy

and Scratchy program. Enclosed is a personally autographed photo of

America's favorite cat and mouse team to add to your collection.

In regards to your specific comments about the show, our research

shows that one person cannot make a difference, no matter how big

a screwball she is, so let me close by saying...

Marge: [reading the letter] And the horse I rode in on?

I'll show them what one screwball can do!

-- A letter from the CEO, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



[End of Act One. Time 5:30]

Marge and her family picket outside the Itchy and Scratchy International

building. She explains to Maude that she's founded S.N.U.H.,

Springfieldians for Nonviolence, Understanding, and Helping. Bart and Lisa

excuse themselves to do wholesome childlike things. [wink wink] Marge's

protest gains momentum...



Marge: [through a megaphone]

How many of you were hit on the heads with mallets last week?

[crowd murmurs]

[man with head bandaged raises his hand]

[another man with head bandaged raises his hand]

[and a whole bunch more]

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Dinner is TV dinners, to Homer's annoyance...



Homer: There's peas in my fruit cobbler!

Lisa: There's peas <everywhere>!

-- The infamous TV dinners, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge apologizes for the dinners and forbids Bart from watching cartoons.

Homer suggests making up for tonight's dinner by making pork chops tomorrow,

but Marge realizes she's too busy running protests.



D'oh! Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.

-- Homer, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



The Krusty the Klown show is on the air...



Krusty: Hi Kids! [laughs] Guess what, Sideshow Mel!

Mel: [slide whistle three times]

Krusty: It's time for Itchy and Scratchy!

Kids: [really, parents] Boo!

Krusty: Hey, hey, settle down boys and girls, or Krusty will

have to bring out his old friend, Corporal Punishment, again.

-- Krusty faces Kancellation, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge leads the parents in a chant...



Marge: What do we want?

Crowd: Less and less violence in children's programming!

Marge: When do we want it?

Crowd: Now!

-- We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any more,

``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Krusty tries to contain the crowd, with no success. Mr. Meyers

reviews the videotape in his office, then holds a meeting.



Meyers: That screwball Marge Simpson, we've got to stop her. But how?

Man #1: Drop an anvil on her?

Man #2: Hit her on the head with a piano.

Woman: Stuff her full of TNT, then throw a match down her throat and run?

Meyers: All your fancy degrees and that's the best you can do?

You make me sick!

All: [agree meekly]

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



The crowd of protesters outside I&S Intl gives a cartoonist an idea...

Homer and Marge watch I&S...



You know, some of these stories are pretty good.

I never knew mice lived such interesting lives.

-- Homer watches Itchy and Scratchy, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



... and this cartoon features a squirrel with a distinctive hairdo who

tells I&S to stop fighting. They whack her head off. Homer fails to

see the connection. Marge is invited to appear on `Smartline'.



Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and welcome to another edition of `Smartline'.

Are cartoons too violent for children? Most people would say, ``No, of

course not, what kind of stupid question is that?''

-- The value of objectivity in reporting, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



His guests are Marge, Roger Meyers (CEO of I&S, Intl), and

Krusty (``Hi, kids!''), and...



Joining us live, via satellite from Vienna, home of Sigmund Freud, the

world's greatest psychiatrist, to give us an insight into the human mind,

Dr. Marvin Monroe.

-- `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''

[Does that make Freud or Monroe the world's greatest psychologist?]



After a brief clip of I&S, the debate begins...



Meyers: I did a little research and I discovered a startling thing...

There was violence in the past, long before cartoons were invented.

Kent: I see. Fascinating.

Meyers: Yeah, and know something, Karl? The Crusades, for instance.

Tremendous violence, many people killed, the darned thing went

on for thirty years.

Kent: And this was before cartoons were invented?

Meyers: That's right, Kent.

-- `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Dr. Marvin Monroe adds his two cents...



Well, Kent, to me, the hijinks of a few comic characters absolutely pales

in comparison to the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into

every day. I'm referring to women who love too much, fear of winning,

sexaholism, stuff like that.

-- Dr. Marvin Monroe on `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Krusty is next...



Kent: For another opinion...

Krusty: [laughs] Hi, kids! [laughs]

Kent: Krusty, please. We're giving you the opportunity to participate in

a serious discussion, here.

Krusty: Oh, I'm sorry Kent. Just that when the camera gets on me, I just...

Hey! [throws a custard pie in his own face] [honks horn]

Kent: Krusty!

Krusty: [honks horn] [cowers]

-- `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge get to make her concluding statement, in which she asks all concerned

parents to write to I&S and express their feelings. In his office, Mr.

Meyers goes through the tons of angry mail he's received... ``The

screwballs have spoken...''

[End of Act Two. Time: 13:00]

While Marge makes her famous pork chops, she takes a phone call from Mr.

Meyers who asks Marge for a nonviolent solution to their cartoon.



Meyers: [explaining on the phone]

Itchy just stole Scratchy's ice cream cone, and...

Animator: Oh, make it a pie. Pies are easier to draw.

Meyers: [to animator] Okay, a pie!

[to Marge] Anyway, Scratchy is understandable upset.

Marge: Uh huh.

Meyers: So we figured he could just, you know, grab Itchy and toss him into

a bucket of acid.

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge: Couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy?

Then they would <both> have pie!

Meyers: [walks to storyboard, considers, steps back]

It's different, I'll give you that...

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Homer watches TV with the kids...



Announcer: It's a tool that every home handyman needs!

It's a jigsaw! It's a power drill! It's a wood-turning lathe!

It's an asphalt spreader! It's 67 tools in one!

How much would you pay for a machine that can do all this?

Homer: One thousand dollars!

Announcer: Oh, don't answer yet...

Homer: Oh, sorry.

Announcer: Because you also get...

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge tells the kids they can watch cartoons again, and they eagerly do

so. But something is subtly different...



They love! They share!

They share and love and share!

Love, love, love!

Share, share, share!

The Itchy and Scratchy Show!

-- A kinder, gentler cartoon, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



`Porch Pals' is completely devoid of content...



Lisa: Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge...

Marge: Well, I think it conveys a very nice message about sharing.

Bart: I think it sucks.

-- A kinder, gentler cartoon, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Homer is startled by Maggie, but she was just handing him a glass of

lemonade. The kids give up.



Marge: Aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?

Bart: Naah. Come on, Li.

Lisa: Maybe there's something else to do on this planet...

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



The scene is repeated in TV rooms all across town, and (to the strains

of the first 53 bars of Beethoven's 6th Symphony) the kids step outside,

rub their eyes, and proceed to do wholesome childlike things.

Krusty meanwhile, tapes his show.



Krusty: Hi, kids! [laughs]

[sees empty studio]

Huh? Is it Saturday?

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



At dinner, Marge asks the kids what they did. Bart and the guys went

fishing, and Lisa and Janie went bird-watching. They excuse themselves

to work on the soapbox racers. Homer is amazed. In Florence...



Artist: This will be the art event of the century. The greatest

masterpiece of the Italian renaissance, Michelangelo's David,

on a coast-to-coast tour of United States.

Reporter: Uh, sir, which cities will be included on your itinerary?

Artist: Eh, New York, Springfield, and if we have time, Chicago,

Boston, Los Angeles.

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge answers the door early in the morning. It's Maude and Helen,

recruiting Marge to protest with them against David.



Helen: You've got to lead our protest against this abomination!

[shows newspaper article]

Marge: Mm, but that's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece.

Helen: [gasp] It's filth! It graphically portrays parts of the human body,

which, practical as they may be, are evil.

Marge: But I like that statue.

Helen: [gasp] I told you she was soft on full frontal nudity!

Come on, girls...

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



The crowd (sans Marge) storm to the airport and tell them to take the

statue away. This prompts another `Smartline' episode.



Is it a masterpiece or just some guy with his pants down?

That's our topic tonight on Smartline...

-- Kent Brockman, on the coming of Michelangelo's David to Springfield,

``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



But Kent is confused when Marge isn't opposed to the statue.



Kent: Aren't you Marge Simpson the wacko?

Marge: Mm... Yes and no.

-- ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Dr. Marvin Monroe (via satellite from Athens, with a camera around his neck)

points out the inconsistency in Marge's logic, since she supports one form

of freedom of expression, but not another. Marge concedes defeat.



I guess one person <can> make a difference, but most of the time,

they probably shouldn't.

-- Marge, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



I'd like to alert our affiliates that we will be ending our show early tonight.

Join us tomorrow, when our topic will be, ``Religion: Which is the one true

faith?''

-- Kent Brockman on `Smartline', ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



The playfields lie unused as the kids are back inside watching cartoons.

I&S pull out bigger and bigger guns until Itchy shoots Scratchy into the

sun. Maggie picks up a toy gun and fires a suction dart, hitting the

photo of Homer square in the eyeball. Marge and Homer go to the museum

to see David.



Well, there he is. Michelangelo's `Dave'.

-- Homer admires Renaissance art, ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge''



Marge is disappointed that the kids, rather than seeing a great piece

of art, are watching a cat and mouse go at each other. But Homer notes...



Homer: Pretty soon, every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School

is going to come and see this thing.

Marge: Really? Why?

Homer: They're forcing 'em! [laughs]

The UCLA visit

On 4 Mar 92, Matt Groening and Nancy Cartwright paid a visit to UCLA.

This episode was shown, followed by an hour of questions and answers.

John Heidemann @{jh} says that, when Groening was asked for his

favorite, he answered that ``Itchy and Scratchy and Marge'' was one of

his favorites. David Silverman admitted to being the basis for the

animator character working at Itchy and Scratchy, Intl.



Left and right

Some concern has been raised for the tendency for episodes to begin by

promoting a liberal point of view, then turning around and going to

the opposite extreme at the end.



Amitava Biswas@{ab} tries to help out:

\Q

I recall hearing an interview of two of the writers (sorry, can't

rememeber the names, some Harvard guys) on Fresh Air with Terry Gross

(National Public Radio) in which they spoke about this very issue of

beginning with a left-wing thing and ending with a right-wing thing.



Their point was that they wanted to show how silly the extremes of

anything can be, left or right. Concerning this episode (``Itchy and

Scratchy and Marge''), the wanton violence in the cartoons is

certainly uncalled for. (It's a crazy thing, isn't it? <If> they

actually made cartoons that were violent and <nothing else>, they

probably wouldn't be very funny, but ``Itchy and Scratchy'' is funny

almost precisely <because> it's not funny...) But censorship has its

down side too.



I do see the point, though, that if you always <end> on the right-wing

message, even if it's patently silly (like the one in ``Mr. Lisa Goes

to Washington''), it can give the implication that [they are

apologizing for their leftist leanings]. Perhaps they should try it

the other way around---starting with a right-wing message and winding

up apologizing for that.



Ultimately, though, it has no meaning. It's just a bunch of stuff that

happened.

Homer's weight tips the couch.





While Bart and his pals crowd around the TV set to watch pro wrestling,

Lisa reads a book.



Live, from the Springfield Center for the Performing Arts,

the wrestling match of the century!

-- Announcer, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Announcer: Rasputin, the friendly Russian!

Lewis: Didn't he use to be the Mad Russian?

Lisa: Yes, but I'm afraid the forces of history have changed

wrestling, perhaps forever.

-- ``Bart the Daredevil''





Bart: [in the Simpsons' living room, watching a wrestling match] \\

If you ask me, this is going to be one helluva match.

Lisa: Oh, Bart, I hope you're not taking this seriously.

Even a 5-year-old knows that this is as choreographed as any ballet!

Homer: [in Moe's tavern] \\

Eh, Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand,

the Professor's got his patented coma lock.

If you ask me, this is going to be one helluva match.

-- Great minds think alike, ``Bart the Daredevil''



The match between Rasputin and Professor Werner von Brawn begins...



Rasputin is spinning the professor like an autogyro.

That's <got> to be disorienting...

-- Announcer for wrestling match, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Bart asks Milhouse to turn up the volume, and steals his seat.

Homer does the same to Barney. Brawn wins the match by cheating.

(What? Pro wrestling has rules?) Next comes a TV advert for

the Monster Truck Rally...



If you miss this, you'd better be dead... or in jail...

And if you're in jail, break out!

-- Announcer for ``Truck-o-Saurus'', ``Bart the Daredevil''



Homer rushes home as Bart rushes to the front door to greet him.

They have the same thing on their mind: Truck-o-Saurus!

At the dinner table...



Homer: I have an announcement to make. As a family growth thing, Bart and

I think we should all go to the monster truck rally this Saturday.

Lisa: Aren't you forgetting something?

Homer: Uh... Monster truck rally... Growth thing. No, I don't think so.

-- at the dinner table, ``Bart the Daredevil''



I'll be playing my first solo! If you miss it on Saturday,

I'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on Sunday.

-- Lisa, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Oh cruel Fate! Why do you mock me?

-- Homer, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Marge points out that they can go to Lisa's recital first, then afterwards

go to the Monster Truck Rally. At the concert...



Skinner: Tonight, Sherberts, oops, heh heh, Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.

Homer: Oh good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long.

Marge: Mmmmm.

-- music recital, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Despite Mr. Largo's exhortation of ``Remember children, stay together!'',

they fall out of step within the first two seconds. (What'd you

expect? They're only eight years old!) Lisa executes her solo, but

Homer is anxious to leave. Todd Flanders has a solo...



Flanders: [weeping at his son's solo] My son! My son!

Homer: Come on Flanders, he's not <that> bad.

-- music recital, ``Bart the Daredevil''



The concert concludes with the 1812 Overture, complete with cannons.

Homer takes Lisa away almost before the last note is played.

He drives recklessly through traffic to get to Springfield Speedway.



I reached him!

-- Lisa, on Homer humming the 1812 Overture while driving recklessly,

``Bart the Daredevil''



but all the parking spots are taken. They accidentally drive into the

arena itself, where they are attacked by Truck-o-Saurus, ``twenty tons

and four stories of car-crunching fire-breathing prehistoric insanity''...

[End of Act One. Time: 6:12]

The car is a total wreck, and the rescue team has trouble pulling

Homer's girth out of the car. The insurance adjuster writes Marge

a check, which she squirrels away in her hair. The family then take

their seats...



Let the destruction begin!

-- Homer, at the Monster Truck Rally, ``Bart the Daredevil''



The last event of the evening is...



The world's greatest daredevil, the man who's no stranger to danger,

if he's not in action, he's in traction... Captain Lance Murdoch!

-- Announcer at Monster Truck Rally, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Ladies and gentlemen, and especially little children. I'm glad you're

all here to witness what may very well be my grisly death. Tonight, my

most dangerous stunt. I will death-defy both nature and gravity by

leaping over this tank of water, filled with man-eating great white sharks,

deadly electric eels, ravenous piranha, bone-crushing alligators, and

perhaps most frightening of all, the king of the jungle, one ferocious lion!

[a lion is added to the pool]

Heh heh heh. I almost forgot. To add a real element of danger, one

drop of human blood.

[pricks his finger, one drop of blood falls in, the pool bubbles furiously]

Now, in case I don't survive, let me just say, seat belts save lives, so

buckle up!

-- Captain Lance Murdoch, at the Monster Truck Rally, ``Bart the Daredevil''



This is <so> cool.

-- Bart, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Aside from Bart, everybody in the arena is too scared to watch. Bart

yells, ``He made it!'' and all cheer. Murdoch takes a curtain call

and falls into the pool, where he is fished out and carted off.

Homer drives what's left of the car home, as Bart daydreams in the

back seat...



Ladies and gentlemen, the ten-year old who's brave and bold,

when he's not in class, he's risking his ass,

the world's greatest daredevil, Bart Simpson!

-- Announcer in Bart's dream, ``Bart the Daredevil''



To the chant of `Bart!', he jumps his skateboard over a pool.

Homer wakes him up.



Bart: Dad, I want to be a daredevil.

Homer: Heh heh heh. Kids say such stupid things.

-- ``Bart the Daredevil''



The next day, Bart tries to jump over a car on his skateboard, but

fails.



Lewis: Oh no, he's hurt.

Richard: Bad.

Milhouse: Let's get out of here!

-- kids after Bart hurts himself doing a stunt, ``Bart the Daredevil''



The family pick up Bart at the hospital.



Marge: Are you all right?

Bart: Better than all right. I got stitches! [lifts the bandage]

Homer+Lisa: Ewwwww.

-- in the hospital, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Dr. Hibbert has an idea of how they can discourage Bart from trying again.



Bart, in this ward are the children who have been hurt by

imitating stunts they saw on television, movies, and the legitimate stage.

-- Dr. Hibbert, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Dr. H: This little boy broke his leg trying to fly like Superman.

This boy's brother hit him in the head with a wrench, mimicking a

recent TV wrestling match.

I won't even subject you to the horrors of our Three Stooges ward.

Marge: Gee, I never realized TV was such a dangerous influence.

Dr. H: Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless

hours of top-notch entertainment.

Homer: Amen!

-- Dr. Hibbert shows Bart the injury ward, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Bart returns to attempt his jump a second time, and he succeeds.

He then jumps over the swimming pool. He jumps over a

string of animals. He jumps over Homer.

On the class trip, Bart mopes because he's run out of things to jump.

Then he sees Springfield Gorge.



Hey, this thing's pretty gnarly.

I bet you could throw a dead body in there, and no one would eeeeever

find it.

-- Otto, on Springfield Gorge, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Bart: Otto, I'm going to leap over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard.

Otto: You know, Bart, as the only adult here, I feel I should say something?

Bart: What?

Otto: COOOOOOOOL!!!!!

-- ``Bart the Daredevil''



[End of Act Two. Time: 12:04]



Otto: [humming into the bus microphone]

Bart: Hey, Otto, can I use that microphone?

Otto: Sorry, Bart-dude, it's for emergencies only.

-- on the bus, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Bart takes the microphone to announce that he's going to jump Springfield

Gorge on Saturday. With Dr. Hibbert's help, Lisa takes Bart to see Captain

Lance Murdoch in the hospital.



Murdoch: [tries to give a thumbs-up sign] Doc, I heard a snap.

Dr. Hibbert: Hm. I'm afraid the bone is broken. Well, that's all of them!

-- in the hospital, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Since he can't use his hand, Murdoch writes a long dedication on an

8 x 10 glossy to Bart by holding the pen in his teeth. (When we eventually

see it, it's an illegible scrawl.) When he learns that Bart intends to

jump Springfield Gorge...



Now let me start by saying... Good for you son!

It's always good to see young people taking an interest in danger.

Now a lot of people are going to be telling you you're crazy,

and maybe they're right. But the fact of the matter is:

Bones heal. Chicks dig scars. And the United States of America

has the best doctor-to-daredevil ratio in the world!

-- Captain Lance Murdoch, upon hearing that Bart wants to do a dangerous stunt,

``Bart the Daredevil''



Lisa is shocked by this. The kids leave as Murdoch asks Bart to tell

the nurse he's ready for his sponge bath. ``Another fringe benefit.''

At the dinner table, Bart is mad that Lisa squealed about his plans

to jump Springfield Gorge.



I'm sorry Bart. But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra

attention I'd receive, I'd miss you.

-- Lisa, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Homer forbids Bart from doing it, but Bart threatens, ``The minute your

back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and heading for that gorge.''



Homer: He's done it, Marge; there's nothing we can do.

He's as good as dead! [bawls]

Marge: You're his father, you've got to try and reason with him.

Homer: Oh, that never works. He's a goner!

-- Bart wants to jump Springfield Gorge on a skateboard, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Marge convinces Homer to have a heart-to-heart talk with Bart.

Homer pays a visit to Bart's room.



Homer: Bart? Bart?

What are you doing?

Bart: [halfway out the window] Uh, nothing.

-- ``Bart the Daredevil''



Homer: You were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you!

Bart: Maybe.

-- Bart and the 9th commandment? ``Bart the Daredevil''



He asks Bart to promise that he won't jump the gorge.



Bart, this isn't one of those phony-baloney promises I don't expect

you to keep!

-- Homer, having a heart-to-heart with Bart, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Bart promises. Homer returns to the dinner table, where we see Bart

skateboard past. Bart arrives at the gorge, where a crowd of kids has

gathered to watch. Homer heads upstairs...



Why that little liar! I should have...

And I was going to play pickle with him.

-- Homer, finding Bart's room empty, ``Bart the Daredevil''



(You need three people to play `pickle'.)

Bart warms up the crowd, then prepares to make his big jump. As he

speeds down the ramp, Homer arrives and tackles him. Homer takes

the skateboard...



I tried ordering you, I tried punishing you, and God help me, I even

tried reasoning with you.

-- Homer to Bart, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Homer says the only thing left is for him to jump the gorge himself.

Bart begs him not to and promises not to jump anything any more.



You know boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right...

-- Homer, slipping away on a skateboard, ``Bart the Daredevil''



Homer speeds down the ramp, and across the gorge. It looks like he's

going to make it, but he doesn't. As if tumbling down the gorge is bad

enough, the skateboard lands on him. A helicopter hauls him up, where he

is placed into an ambulance. The ambulance tries to speed away, but

immediately crashes into a tree; the back doors open, and Homer falls out,

back down the gorge.

In the hospital, Homer gets the bed next to Captain Lance Murdoch.



You think you've got guts. Try raising my kids.

-- Homer to Murdoch, ``Bart the Daredevil''

At the gorge, Nelson (the bully) says, ``Where is he? I thought he said

noon!'' but notice that Milhouse's mouth also moves to the words.



(And, as a plot discontinuity, Bart never said he was going to jump at noon.

He said, ``May I have your attention, please? This Saturday, I will be

jumping over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard. There is a good possibility

I will plunge to my bloody death. Hope to see you there! Thank you.'')



As Homer and Bart walk to the house after coming home from Truck-o-Sarus,

as they walk from the driveway, they are shaded on their backs, as though

the light is coming from the left. When they turn to go inside, walking away

from the viewer, the shading remains on their backs.



But this isn't an animation error. There are two light sources in the

scene. The first is the streetlamps, which provides the first shadow.

The second is the lights from the house, which provides the second shadow.



Bart's T-shirt

Tim P. McNerney @{tpm} observes that Bart's

skull-and-crossbones T-shirt he wears for the jump across the gorge

has a skull with ``Bart-spikes''.



But Jym Dyer @{jd} recalls that the

X-rays in ``Bart Gets Hit By A Car'' shows a

normal skull. (Normal for cartoon characters, that is.) Bart's spiked skull

is clearly a matter of artistic license on his part.

bit too highbrow (and difficult!)\ for a bunch of eight-year-olds.



Mr. Largo counts, ``five, six, seven, eight'' before giving the

downbeat. Unfortunately, the Unfinished Symphony begins in 12/8 time.

(So he really should have counted either, ``7 8 9 10 11 12'' or just

``3 4''.) And, of course, the tempo he sets is nothing like the tempo

the orchestra plays. (And, the symphony doesn't even begin that way.

Mr. Largo skipped the introductory bars.)



There is no saxophone part in the Unfinished Symphony, a fortiori, no

saxophone solo.



The playing itself was down to school standards. Despite Mr. Largo's

exhortation of ``Remember children, stay together,'' they fall out of

step at the moment the first note is played. And the conclusion of

the 1812 Overture was the embodiment of school concerts. Everybody

had long since fallen out of step with everybody else, and moved on to

bigger and better things like playing the wrong note.



When Homer says, ``How much longer was Sherbert planning on making

this junk!'', the symphony comes to an end, and all applaud.

Unfortunately, what was played was only the end of the first movement.

The piece was only halfway finished---to the extent that `halfway

finished' applies to an unfinished symphony.

Perfectly in keeping with

what always happens at school concerts. (Parents applaud during

any break in the action.)



And as the Symphony started, you could hear Maggie sucking away.



Principal Skinner announced that it was the first in a series of Saturday

Evening Concerts. This is way beyond the abilities of a student orchestra.

It typically takes grammar school orchestras 10 to 14 weeks to prepare for

a single concert. (Unless they intend to have other performing groups

fill in, like Bart's fourth-grade dance demonstration.)



The only thing missing that I could think of was flashbulbs going off

intermittently as eager parents take pictures of their kids, unaware that

the flashes are immensely distracting. (And useless beyond 15 feet.)



Lisa's solo

Brian Heil @{bh3} makes

another interesting note about the concert and Lisa's sax solo: ``I haven't

paid close enough attention in the past to say if Lisa is lefthanded, but I

assume she is, seeing the way she held the saxophone. Of course lefthanded

sax players hold it the same way as righthanded players... in fact it is nearly

impossible to play a sax as it was pictured!''



Todd's solo

Theron Stanford @{tws} identifies Todd's solo as `My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice'

from the opera ``Samson and Delilah'' by Camille Saint-Sa\"ens.



Alan J Rosenthal @{ajr} notes that Todd's bowing was very odd. When he held

a note, he stopped the bow movement. Of course, this would stop the sound.



Butchered in America

Scenes were removed from the original US airing to make room for the ``Do

the Bart Man'' video on first airing, then again for a Gulf War Update

when the episode repeated. Canadians received a full episode.



One cut scene involved the introduction of a female truck driver at the

monster truck rally. Note Lisa, ``Another barrier broken.''

Bart vs. Thanksgiving

Written by George Meyer

Directed by David Silverman

Blackboard

{I will not do that thing / with my tongue.}

{I will not do that thi} at cutoff.



Driveway

Homer says nothing when Lisa scoots past.



Couch

The family find Grampa on the couch, who mutters incoherently.





Humming `Greensleeves', Marge snaps on a pair of latex gloves and proceeds

to unstuff the turkey. Maggie descends from her high chair and pays a

visit to the living room.



Lisa: Mmph. [as Bart muffles her with a cushion]

Homer: Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!

Bart: She took my glue!

Lisa: It's not yours, Bart. This is family glue!

Homer: Stop it, you two. This is Thanksgiving, so glue friendly or I'll take

your glue away and then <no one> will have any glue to glue with.

-- ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Lisa: Dad, this isn't about glue. It's about territoriality.

He only wants the glue because I'm using it.

Bart: Oh yeah? Prove it.

Lisa: [hands him the glue] Here.

Bart: Hey man, I don't want your stupid glue.

-- ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart tosses the glue away, and it lands in front of Maggie. She reaches

toward it, but Lisa snatches it before Maggie can mistake it for a bottle

of formula. Lisa heads upstairs, and Maggie follows.



Bill: Uh oh, here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose.

Homer: Heh heh heh, Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.

Bill: Uh oh, looks like ol' Bullwinkle's kinda gotten a taste of his

own medicine. Ha ha.

Marty: He certainly does, Bill.

Bill: Ha ha. Wait, what did... Did what I say make sense?

Marty: Well, no, not really Bill.

Bill: Boy, now I know how the pilgrims felt.

Marty: What are you talking about, Bill?

-- Watching the Thanksgiving Day parade, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart doesn't recognize Bullwinkle or Underdog and complains that they

ought to use ``cartoons made in the last fifty years.''



Son, this is a tradition. If they start building a balloon for every

flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'll turn the parade into a FARCE.

[the Bart Simpson balloon floats past]

-- Homer watches the Thanksgiving Day parade with Bart,

``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''

[a little meta-humor for your enjoyment]



Maggie makes a dangerous trek up the stairs, dodging a skateboard, frayed

electrical wires, and other roadblocks. Lisa shows Maggie the centerpiece

she's been working on, ``a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our

country great,'' including Georgia O'Keefe, Susan B. Anthony, and Margery

Stoneman Douglas (who worked to preserve the Everglades). She invites

Maggie to make a contribution. Maggie scrawls on the centerpiece with a

magic marker, and Lisa embraces her. ``Oh, thank you.''

In the kitchen, Marge asks Bart to stay out of her way, so he offers to

help out. Marge asks him to do the cranberry sauce. Bart has trouble

finding the can, then the can opener. Then he is unable to get the can

opener to work.



It's broken, Mom. ... Mom, it's broken. ... [sings] Mom-it's-brok-en,

Mom-it's-brok-en, Mom-it's-brok-en, Mom-it's-brok-en....

-- Bart `helps out' in the kitchen, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Marge opens the can, and Bart slowly lets the sauce glop onto the plate,

still in the cylindrical shape from the can. ``Ah, cranberry sauce a la

Bart.'' Marge asks Bart to put it in the fridge, but Bart has already

left. Before Marge gets to it, the sauce collapses into an amorphous glob.

Maggie wanders into the living room, where Homer is watching TV.



See Maggie, those silver-and-blue guys are the Dallas Cowboys. They're

Daddy's favorite team. And he wants them to lose by less than five and

a half points. Understand?

-- Homer, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



The receiver takes a nasty hit. He's flat on his back.



Looks like they'll be feeding him Thanksgiving dinner through a tube.

-- Sportscaster on the football player's injury, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Marge reminds Homer to pick up Grampa, and Homer defers it until halftime.

Patty and Selma arrive, carrying pots of Swedish meatballs and trout

almandine, respectively. Marge is upset that they don't trust her

cooking. They explain that they merely brought backups in case some

people found her turkey too dry. Homer greets the twins and leaves to

pick up Grampa.

In the car, Homer angrily mimics Patty and Selma's grunting, then turns

on the car radio.



Announcer: And now, get set for our fabulous halftime show, featuring the

well-groomed young go-getters of `Hooray for Everything!'

Homer: Oh, I love those kids. They've got such a great attitude!

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, `Hooray for Everything' invites you

to join them in a salute to the greatest hemisphere on earth,

the Western Hemisphere! The dancingest hemisphere of all!

-- Football halftime show, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Homer `dances' his fingers and shoulders and bobs his head to the music.

He arrives at the retirement home, where their dinner is about to begin.



Now, before we sit down to our delicious turkey puree, I have some, uh,

happy news. The following people have relatives who wished they could

be here today...

-- At the rest home, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



He reads off a list of names, and a fax comes in. ``Oh, and Mrs. Spencer,

you too.'' ``Oh, I knew they wouldn't forget me.'' Homer comes in

and drags Grampa away.

A taxi pulls in front of the house, and Marge's mother comes out.



I have laryngitis. It hurts to talk. So I'll just say one thing...

You never do anything right.

-- Mrs. Bouvier, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Maggie is watching the end of the halftime show as Marge brings food

from the kitchen to the dining table.



Thank you! You're super! Be good to each other!

-- `Hoorary for Everything' entertains during the football halftime show,

``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



In the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs, as `Hooray for Everything'

leaves the field! Of course, a stadium is much too big for flash pictures

to work, but nobody seems to care!

-- Announcer for the halftime show, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Homer tries to get a fire started in the fireplace with a set of bellows,

but isn't making any progress. Marge calls that dinner is ready (``The

hell with this!'' yells Homer), and the guests are seated. Lisa comes

down with the centerpiece.



Holy moley! That's the biggest... one of those I ever saw!

-- Homer appreciates Lisa's Thanksgiving dinner table centerpiece,

``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



``Definitely from our side of the family,'' notes Selma. Lisa's

description of the centerpiece is interrupted by Bart, who brings

in the turkey. He tells Lisa to move the centerpiece to free up

``valuable real estate'' for the turkey. Bart and Lisa struggle

for the centerpiece, which lands in the fireplace. The fire roars

to life. (``Hey, that got 'er goin'!'' observes Grampa.) Lisa

attacks Bart, crying, ``You don't even care!'', then runs upstairs

to her room in tears.



Homer: All right Bart, that's it! Go to your room! Now!

Bart: Okay, I'll take some white meat and stuffing to go, and

send up the pumpkin pie in about 20 minutes.

-- ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Marge scolds, ``I hope you're happy, Bart! You've ruined Thanksgiving!''

[End of Act One. Time: 8:17]

Bart grumbles in his room. Downstairs...



And Lord, we are especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest,

safest energy source there is. Except for solar, which is just a pipe dream.

Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and

love our family has experienced. Well, not today, but... You saw what

happened! Oh, Lord, be honest! Are we the most pathetic family in the

universe or what!

-- Homer says grace at Thanksgiving dinner, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



``Amen'' says all. ``Worst prayer yet,'' notes Selma. Lisa's sax

playing can be heard downstairs, and Marge goes up to talk to her.



Lisa: Mom, I poured my heart into that centerpiece! [which Bart destroyed]

Things like that <always> happen in this family.

Marge: I noticed that, too.

-- ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Marge tells Bart he can come down to dinner if he apologizes to Lisa.

Bart scoffs, ``They think they can starve an apology out of me? Ha!''

He climbs out the window and down a nearby tree, landing in a patch of

daisies. ``Uh oh. ... I mean, good!'' and starts stomping the flowers

with renewed vigor. Santa's Little Helper is thrown out of the house

for swiping a drumstick. Bart and SLH head off. They find Monty Burns'

mansion. Inside, Burns congratulates Smithers on yet another excellent

repast. ``I couldn't eat another bite. Dispose of all this.'' Burns

indicates a huge banquet table still loaded with food. Though he did

save room for some pumpkin pie, which is cooling on the window sill.

Bart climbs through the hedges, spots the pie, and reaches for it. But

his hand crosses laser beam detectors, and Burns' security are alerted.

``The intruder appears to be a young male, age 9 to 11.'' Burns responds,

``Release the hounds.'' Bart narrowly escapes with his life.

Meanwhile, Lisa is in her room at her desk.



I saw the best meals of my generation

destroyed by the madness of my brother.

My soul carved in slices

by spikey-haired demons.

-- `Howl of the Unappreciated' by Lisa Simpson, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart reassures SLH that they'll get food, ``even if we have to pay for it.''

Bart crosses railroad tracks to the seedy part of town.



Cool! The wrong side of the tracks!

-- Bart crosses the railroad tracks, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



He spots a sign in the Springfield Plasma Center, offering to pay $12

for a blood donation.



Twelve bucks! Hey, I can bleed!

-- Bart observes he can make $12 by giving blood, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Nurse: Hey, you've gotta be eighteen to sell your blood. Let's see some ID.

Bart: Here ya go, doll-face.

Nurse: Okay, Homer, just relax.

Bart: Ow!

-- Bart gives blood to make some money, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Back home...



At the risk of losing my voice, let me just say one more thing:

I'm sorry I came.

-- Mrs. Bouvier makes a rare comment, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Selma wonders when Bart will apologize. ``He sure is stubborn.''



Grampa: Homer was never stubborn. He always folded instantly over anything.

It was as if he had no will of his own. Isn't that true, Homer?

Homer: [sycophantically] Yes, Dad.

-- ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart staggers out of the Plasma Center, a cookie in his hand.



Twelve bucks and a free cookie! What a country! [passes out]

-- Bart gives blood, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



SLH eats the cookie.

[End of Act Two. Time: 13:12]

Two street bums find Bart and take him to a soup kitchen.



All right! Twelve big ones and free grub to boot. Viva Skid Row!

-- Bart learns about life on the wrong side of the tracks,

``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Kent Brockman from Channel 6 (KWZ) is making a live news report.



Kent: Oh, we have lots of names for these people. Bums, deadbeats, losers,

scums of the earth. We'd like to sweep these people into the gutter,

or if they're already in the gutter, to some other out-of-the-way

place. Oh, we have our reasons. They're depressing, they wear

ragged clothes, they're [makes quotation sign with fingers] ``crazy'',

they smell bad.

Guy: Hey, listen, man.

Kent: [whispers] Wait, I'm going somewhere with this.

-- Kent Brockman's Emmy-winning news report from a soup kitchen,

``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



The family are watching the report on TV.



Marge: Everyone, Lisa wants to read us a poem she's written.

Grampa: Sounds interesting.

Homer: Oh, okay.

Lisa: Ahem. `Howl of the Unappreciated'. By Lisa Simpson. Ahem.

`I saw the best meals...' [Bart appears on television]

Grampa: Gasp. It's Bart!

Homer: What show is <this>?

-- Bart manages to upstage Lisa from miles away, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Kent: And how long have you been on the streets?

Bart: Going on five years, Kent.

Kent: Ah. Son, your family may be watching. Is there anything you'd like

to say to them?

Bart: Yes there is, Kent. Ha ha! I didn't apologize!

-- Bart is interviewed for a television documentary, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Operator, give me the number for nine-one-one!

-- Homer, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Kent packs his things and leaves. ``This reporter smells another local

Emmy.'' One of the bums asks Bart if he's got a place to sleep. Bart

says, ``There's this family I kinda hang out with.'' The soup kitchen

cook says, ``See you at Christmas,'' and closes the doors. Bart finds

the money in his pocket. ``Uh, listen guys, I was thinking. Unless

you feel weird about taking money from a kid, I thought maybe...'' He

gives them the money and rushes home.

The two cops tell Homer that Bart isn't at the Rescue Mission any more

and ask what prompted Bart to run away.

The Thanksgiving dinner guests head for home.



If I'm not back at the home by nine they declare me legally dead and

collect my insurance!

-- Grampa rushes back to the rest home, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



In the living room...



Marge: Homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't

blame ourselves.

Homer: We can and will!

Marge: Children need discipline. You can ask any syndicated advice columnist.

-- Worrying about Bart, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart reaches the front door and wonders if he should go inside... He

dreams of being greeted warmly by the family. Marge asks, ``Isn't there

something you'd like to say to your sister?'' Bart responds, ``Okay.

I'm sorry, too.'' The lighting suddenly turns grim. Marge scolds, ``No,

no, no! That won't do at all!'' Homer says, ``Yeah, boy. Get down

on your knees and BEG for forgiveness!'' Lisa evilly adds, ``Yeah. Beg

me Bart. Beg me!'' Bart does so, but they just laugh in his face.



Marge: Now we can blame him for everything!

Homer: It's your fault I'm bald!

Bart: [meekly] I'm sorry.

Grampa: It's your fault I'm old!

Bart: I'm sorry!

Maggie: It's your fault I can't talk!

Bart: I'm sorry!

Uncle Sam: It's your fault America has lost its way!

Bart: I'm sorry!

All: It's all your fault! It's all your fault! It's all your fault!

-- Bart's dream, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart returns to reality. ``I'm sorry all right. Sorry I came back here.''

He climbs a tree and hops onto the roof.



Whoa! My whiffle balls! My frisbees! My water rockets!

I've hit the jackpot!

-- Bart climbs to the roof, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart plays football on the roof. Meanwhile, Lisa is at her desk.



Dear Log: My brother is still missing, and maybe it's my fault because

I failed to take his abuse with good humor. I miss him so much already

that I don't... know... [sobs]

-- Lisa writes in her diary, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Bart hears Lisa's sobbing through a ventilation pipe and invites her up.

Lisa joins him on the roof.



Lisa: Bart, what are you doing up here? Everybody's worried!

Bart: Really? Did they cry?

Lisa: Yes.

Bart: Whoa! Bulls-eye!

-- Lisa joins Bart on the roof after his brief career as a runaway,

``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



She asks why he burnt her centerpiece. ``Was it because you hate me?

Or because you're bad.''



I don't know! I don't know why I did it! I don't know why I enjoyed it!

And I don't know why I'll do it again!

-- Bart doesn't apologize to Lisa, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



Lisa tells him, ``The only reason to apologize is if you look deep down

inside yourself, and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there

because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feeling.'' Bart gives in

and closes his eyes. ``This is so stupid. I'm not going to find anything.

Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on, and I made

her cr---... Uh oh. ... I'm sorry, Lisa.'' Lisa accepts the apology.

Homer peeks out from the bathroom window.



You know, Marge? We're great parents!

-- Homer watches Bart apologize to Lisa on the roof, ``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



At 11pm, the family are gathered around the kitchen table...



Homer: Oh Lord, on this blessed day, we thank Thee for giving our family

one more crack at togetherness.

All: Amen.

-- Homer says grace at the second Thanksgiving dinner,

``Bart vs. Thanksgiving''



They then dig into turkey sandwiches.

Maggie Roswell (Mrs. Spencer, Nurse)



... additional voices were supplied by Greg Berg and

Maggie Roswell (Mrs. Spencer)?

... the obvious proctological reference in the first scene?

... right on the word FARCE (which Homer bellows out in classic Homer

style) the Bart balloon comes on screen? Not coincidentally,

1990 was the year the Bart Simpson balloon was added to the Macy's

Thanksgiving Parade.

... when Bart got in the way, Marge kneed him in the back! @{cjb}

... Homer got Patty and Selma backwards when he greeted them at the door?

... Homer has an eight-track player in his car? And it said `Hi-fi'

on it, at that?

... all the coughing in the background at the rest home?

... the fanfare Bart hums as he brings in the turkey is the fanfare

that Twentieth Century Fox uses?

... when Lisa runs off crying, there's a glass of milk on its side

on the floor? (Literally crying over spilt milk?) Patty and

Selma had picked up their glasses before Lisa and Bart's struggle,

but apparently one glass got away.

... Bart is sent to his room at 4pm?

... when Bart went through the sewer, the graffiti was signed `El Barto'?

... Mr. Burns has peacocks on his lawn?

outside world' at the rest home has no handle and only swings inward,

not out?

passenger side door, but Marge's mother gets out the other side?

... Marge's mother doesn't use the front door, but walks around to the back

door? (Note the turkey decoration on the back door, or is it a door

knocker?)

when Homer throws out Santa's Little Helper?

... the tiny cup and saucer in front of Maggie?

... the `Psycho' or `The Munsters' type house peeking over the drainage

pipe when Bart comes out? (Or is it the haunted house from ``Treehouse

of Horror''?)

... one of Mr. Burns' guards is reading `Les Miserables' while eating a

T.V. dinner?

... when the family is watching T.V., Marge's mother appears to be wearing

big thick shoes, or could they be `Army Boots'?

... when Bart's on the roof, you see the outdoor T.V. antenna? Obviously

not used. (The position of the antenna sometime changes from scene

to scene and episode to episode.)

Springfield Retirement Castle a short walk away from the Simpsons residence.

Yet in this episode, the Castle is a Home, and Homer has to drive there.



Bennett W. Cleveland and Dennis Ward point out that Homer is watching the

Dallas Cowboys, yet the announcer says they are in the Silverdome, home of

the Detroit Lions. By tradition (since the 1940's), the Lions always play

Thanksgiving at home. In the 1960's the Cowboys were also granted that

honor. So they couldn't possibly be playing each other.

Music

The Thanksgiving Day Parade

The music for the parade was Sousa's `Washington Post March', I think.



It changes to something else when Bullwinkle appears.



Hooray for Everything

Chris Lipski recognizes the music used by `Hooray for Everything' as ``Get

Dancin' '' by Disco Tex and his Sex-o-lettes. ``One of my fave disco cheezee

hits from the 70's'' he says.



We Gather Together To Ask the Lord's Blessing

The ``hit Protestant prayer tune'' @{cep} appears thrice as incidental music.

\Q

1. when Mrs. Bouvier comes out of the taxi. \\

2. when Lisa brings down the centerpiece. \\

3. when the family sit down for their second Thanksgiving dinner.

\eQ

Stephen W. Smoliar (smoliar\@hilbert.iss.nus.sg) consulted his hymnal:

\Q

We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing, \\

He chastens and hastens His will to make known; \\

The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing. \\

Sing praises to His name--He forgets not His own.

\eQ

Roger Lustig (roger\@phoenix.princeton.edu) says it's an old hymn tune from

Colonial times, if not earlier.



The soup kitchen

The music playing at the soup kitchen is the same music that was playing

at SNPP in `Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire' [7[FG]08].



Lisa's Poem

Constance Stillinger (connie\@sushi.psych.nwu.edu) points out that

Lisa's poem derives from `Howl' by Allen Ginsberg:

\Q

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by

madness, starving hysterical naked....

\eQ

Note the copy of Ginsberg works on Lisa's bookshelf.



This and other poems by Lisa are archived in `The Simpsons Uncensored Family

Album'.



Mr. Burns's mansion

The Burns mansion is located at the corner of Croesus and Mammon.



Croesus was the last king of Lydia (560 - 546 BC) known for his great wealth.

By extension, it means any rich man. There is an idiom, `Rich as Croesus'.



David Tamkin @{dwt} adds:



Mammon, derived from the classical Hebrew word for personal wealth,

came to be used as a name for a postulated god of greed (or personification

of greed) in medieval literature. A typical usage was ``worshiping Mammon

instead of the Lord.''



Evidently Burns got to name those streets himself. At least he gave his

guards on duty frozen dinners with turkey in them.



Misc.

This episode gets my vote for best music. ``We gather together to ask

the Lord's blessing...''

Marge reminds him that Bart is doing a science experiment.



One o'clock. Still just a potato.

Ned suggests Homer use some time-release granules to get rid of the

crabgrass. Homer denies that he has any. Ned points out a few patches,

``There. There. And there's a big patch over there.''



There's nothing wrong with crabgrass. It just has a bad name, that's all.

Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like, eh, `elfgrass'.

Ned invites Homer into the Rumpus Room for some of his beer. Homer

accepts. ``I deserve a little break.'' Pull back to reveal that Homer

has mowed about twenty square feet.

Homer is awed by the beauty of Ned's Rumpus Room. Maude comes in with

a tray of club sandwiches for the guys. Ned draws a beer from his very

own tap.



Ned: Here's a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland.

Homer: Well, buggers can't be choosy.

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Homer downs the mug and burps. Todd comes in and thanks Ned for his help

with his science project. Homer drinks another beer as he watches the

two engage in some typically Flanders-like conversation.



Homer: All right, knock it off!

Ned: Knock what off, Simpson?

Homer: You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here!

Your family is better than my family, your beer comes from <farther>

away, than my beer, you and your son like each other, and your wife's

<butt>...

Ned: [gasp!]

Homed: ... is higher than my wife's butt! You make me sick!

Ned: Simpson, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I hope you

understand.

Homer: Lousy bragging know-it-all showoff...

Marge: What exactly did he say?

Homer: Get this. He said, uh, he said...

Well, it wasn't so much what he said; it was how he said it.

Marge: Well, how did he say it?

Homer: Well, he...

Marge: Was he angry?

Homer: No.

Marge: Was he rude?

Homer: Okay, okay, it wasn't how he said it, either.

-- It's the thought that counts, ``Dead Putting Society''



``But the message was loud and clear: Our family stinks.''

Marge notes that Ned's been nothing but a perfect neighbor, and Homer

latches onto the word `perfect' and decides to take a walk to calm down.

Meanwhile, Ned also has difficulty sleeping.



I drag him over here, he has a few beers... You can't blame him for erupting.

-- Ned Flanders, ``Dead Putting Society''



Maude suggests she isn't the person Ned should be talking to. So Ned

calls Rev. Lovejoy.



Mrs. Lovejoy: Honey, wake up. Honey, it sounds like Ned Flanders is

having some sort of crisis.

Rev. Lovejoy: Oh. Probably stepped on a worm...

-- Flanders calls in the middle of the night, ``Dead Putting Society''



Ned: I feel like I violated Matthew 19:19.

Rev.L: Huh?

Ned: Love thy neighbor.

Rev.L: Oh, Matthew <nineteen> nineteen, yeah, right, right.

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Rev. Lovejoy suggests, ``A gentle answer turneth away wrath,'' then

immediately hangs up. Ned sits down and writes a letter.

Ned slips the letter under the Simpsons front door, and is startled by

Homer, returning from his walk. Ned apologetically gives Homer the

letter and leaves. Homer reads it... and laughs.

At the breakfast table...



Homer: [reading Ned's letter] ``You are my brother.''

Homer+Lisa+Bart: [giggle]

Homer: ``I love you.''

Homer+Lisa+Bart: [laugh]

Homer: ``And yet, I feel a great sadness...'' [tries to stifle a giggle]

``... in my bosom.''

Homer+Lisa+Bart: [finally lose it and laugh uproariously]

-- Reading Ned's letter of apology, ``Dead Putting Society''



Marge scolds them for laughing and excuses herself into the next room,

where she giggles, then returns.



Read the `bosom' part again, Dad!

-- Lisa, ``Dead Putting Society''



Marge tries to restore order.



Bosom.

-- Bart, ``Dead Putting Society''



Marge wishes that her family was as close as the Flanderses. So Homer

offers to take the family miniature golfing, followed by frosty chocolate

milkshakes.



Mm. I <was> going to wash my hair...

-- Marge, after Homer suggests the family go miniature golfing,

``Dead Putting Society''



Lisa: And I'm studying for the math fair.

If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.

Homer: Too bad we don't live on a farm.

-- Homer suggests the family go miniature golfing, ``Dead Putting Society''



Homer takes Bart and Maggie.

Homer putts the ball into the center hole... which deposits the ball in

the parking lot. A passing car kicks the ball down the street.



Play it where it lays, Homer.

-- Bart after Homer botches a putt, ``Dead Putting Society''



Maggie wanders off and takes a free ride on the windmill. Meanwhile,

Homer struggles with a mechanical ape obstacle.



Give up homeboy, there's a six stroke limit.

-- Bart after Homer botches a putt, ``Dead Putting Society''



The ball goes up the ramp... bangs off the ape's opening-and-closing

mouth... and returns to the tee. Homer hops angrily. Ned and Todd

stop by.



Todd: Hi Bart!

Bart: Get bent.

-- friendly greetings at the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''



Ned: Oh say, you look like you were having a little trouble there.

Homer: That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it!

-- at the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''



Todd suggests playing more conservatively. Go around, rather than through

the obstacle, ``setting yourself up for an easy deuce.'' Todd does so,

and manages to get a hole-in-one.

They reach Ye End of Course.



Bart: Final score. Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see...

six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus...

Homer: Never mind!

-- leaving the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''



They spot a sign for a miniature golf tournament.



Todd: Wow! First prize fifty dollars!

Bart: Wow! Free balloons for everyone who enters!

-- A matter of perspective, ``Dead Putting Society''



Ned: So, my little Bartly, thinking of entering the tournament?

Homer: Yeah, he's entering.

And what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?

Bart: I guess it's possible...

Ned: Hey hey, I like that confidence.

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Ned notes that Todd is a rather good player.



Oh yeah? Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins

any day of the week! C'mon boy!

-- Homer tells off Flanders, ``Dead Putting Society''



At the soda fountain.



Bart: But Dad! I've never won anything in my life!

Homer: Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is <not>

okay to lose!

-- The ghost of Vince Lombardi? ``Dead Putting Society''



[End of Act One. Time: 8:59]



Keep your head down, follow through. [Bart putts and misses]

Okay, that didn't work. This time, move your head and don't follow through.

-- Homer giving putting advice, ``Dead Putting Society''



Marge and Lisa watch disapprovingly from the house.

Practice over, Bart returns to his room and tosses his putter carelessly

aside.



Homer: What are you doing! That putter is to you what a bat is

to a baseball player! What a violin is... to the... the guy that...

the violin guy! Now c'mon! Give your putter a name.

Bart: What?

Homer: C'mon, give it a name.

Bart: Mister Putter.

Homer: D'oh... You wanna try a little harder son? C'mon give it a girl's

name.

Bart: Mom.

Homer: Your putter's name is Charlene!

Bart: Why?

Homer: It just is, that's why! Now this, is a picture of your enemy,

Todd Flanders. Every day, I want you to spend fifteen minutes

staring at it. And concentrating on how much you hate him, and how

glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him!

Bart: Who's Charlene?

Homer: [raises the putter, about to wallop Bart with it]

I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!

Bart: Grrrrrrrr... rrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!! [loses enthusiasm]

-- a pep talk, ``Dead Putting Society''



Todd says hello from his room.

Homer raids the fridge.



Marge: Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you warp Bart's mind.

Homer: And?

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Marge: I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little

kiddie golf tournament.

Homer: But Marge, but this is our big chance to show up the Flandereses. [sic]

Marge: Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?

Homer: Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by

making someone else look bad. And I'm tired of making other people feel

good about themselves!

-- Marge concerned over Homer's tactics, ``Dead Putting Society''



Bart surveys his less-than-impressive awards shelf.



Bart: Hey Lis, whaddya call those guys in chess that don't matter.

Lisa: Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think you're

referring to a pawn.

Bart: Right. I am a pawn.

Lisa: Hmm... I know. It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has little

to no interest in almost everything I do.

Bart, I think I can help you.

-- Lisa offers some sisterly advice, ``Dead Putting Society''



``Our journey begins here at the library.'' She greets everyone, then

heads for the card catalog.



Golf... `Anecdotes'... `Eisenhower and'... `fishing'... `humor'...

`Japanese obsession with'... Ah, here it is... `Putting'.

-- Lisa, looking through card catalog under `Golf', ``Dead Putting Society''



Bart: Lisa, we can't afford all these books!

Lisa: Bart, we're just gonna borrow them.

Bart: Oh... heh, heh... gotcha! [wink]

-- in the library, ``Dead Putting Society''



As haunting music plays, Bart and Lisa sit in the lotus position

alongside a lake.



Lisa: I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.

Bart: Okay.

Lisa: Embrace nothingness.

Bart: You got it.

Lisa: Become like an uncarved stone.

Bart: Done.

Lisa: Bart, you're just pretending to know what I'm talking about!

Bart: True.

Lisa: Well, it's very frustrating!

Bart: I'll bet.

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Lisa and Bart sit atop a mountain.



Lisa: What is the sound of one hand clapping?

Bart: Piece of cake. [claps with one hand]

Lisa: No, Bart, it's a 3000-year-old riddle with no anwer.

It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought.

Bart: No answer? Lisa, listen up! [claps with one hand]

-- Solving unsolved problems, ``Dead Putting Society''



Lisa tries again.



Lisa: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?

Bart: Absolutely! [makes the sound of a tree falling]

Lisa: But Bart, how can sound exist if there's no one there to hear it.

Bart: Wooooooo...

Lisa: [hands Bart his putter] It is time.

-- Bart finally gets it, ``Dead Putting Society''



At the miniature golf course, Lisa takes out a measuring tape.



Lisa: The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. All you have

to do is hit the ball... here.

[Tap] [Clunk-clunk] [Clunk-clunk] [Duh-dunk]

Bart: I can't believe it.

You've actually found a practical use for geometry!

-- at the miniature golf course, ``Dead Putting Society''



Bart sinks several more putts. Lisa holds an umbrella over Bart as he

putts. The course rained out, they practice on a pool table. Back at

the course, Bart sinks a putt blindfolded and standing on one leg.

Bart poses on the garbage can in the backyard. Homer tells him to stop

before the neighbors see, but too late. Ned asks what's up, and Homer

promises that Bart will mop the floor with Todd's butt.



Ned: May the best man win.

Homer: ``May the best man win.'' The mating call of the loser!

-- From one who should know, ``Dead Putting Society''



Homer dares Ned to bet on the outcome, so Ned offers to wager one of Maude's

wind chimes against a batch of Marge's blueberry muffins. Homer asks Ned

to make a ``real'' bet and makes chicken sounds for quite a long time.



Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.

-- Ned Flanders, ``Dead Putting Society''



Yelling at the top of their lungs, the two agree to make the father of the

loser mow the winner's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress. Marge reluctantly

draws up the terms of the agreement. Ned suggests they phrase the bet as

``the father of the boy who doesn't win'' to avoid hurt feelings. Marge

writes up the bet and asks, ``I hope blood won't be necessary.'' Once

Ned steps outside, he asks himself, ``Good gravy, what have I done?''

Homer, Bart, and Lisa are at the miniature golf course yet again.



Homer: Keep your left arm straight, Bart! Rotate your shoulders!

Lisa+Bart: Daaaad!

Homer: Look son, all I'm asking is that you try.

Bart: Ok, I'll try.

Homer: D'oh! Anybody can try! I want you to <win>!

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Bart swats at the ball, which bounces off an obstacle and careens back

towards Homer, who ducks out of the way.

Homer fishes through the closet. He holds up two of Marge's dresses.

``Give me your honest opinion. This... or this?''

[End of Act Two. Time: 15:15]

Homer stands vigil over Bart's bed. Bart wakes up, sees Homer, and

screams. Homer gently reminds Bart that today is the day of the

tournament, and less gently threatens Bart that he'd better win.

Downstairs, Marge prepares a breakfast of steak and eggs.

Homer reads the paper...



Heh heh heh. That crazy Marmaduke.

-- Homer reads the morning paper, ``Dead Putting Society''



... while Lisa drills Bart one last time.



Lisa: Eighth hole.

Bart: Aim for the octopus, third tentacle.

Lisa: Twelfth hole.

Bart: Bank it off the pink tombstone.

Lisa: Nirvanha.

Bart: A state of bliss obtained through the extinction of the self.

-- pre-game drills, ``Dead Putting Society''



Lisa refuses to let Bart eat steak and eggs. Bart is on a strict diet

of complex carbohydrates; steak will make him logey. Lisa suggests a

breakfast of oatmeal.



Lisa: Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she

wins the Kentucky Derby.

Homer: Newsflash, Lisa, Bart is not a horse!

-- the breakfast table the day of the contest, ``Dead Putting Society''



``Eat your steak, boy.''

Tournament preparations are complete.



Good afternoon everybody, and welcome to the finale of what has already been

a stirring afternoon of miniature golf. The cream has risen. The

wheat has bid farewell to the chaff. And now, we approach the

championship match where but two warriors remain: The heretofore

unknown Bart Simpson and Todd Flanders, one of the most skilled

ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade.

-- K.B.B.L. announcer, ``Dead Putting Society''



Lisa: Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself,

I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. But here goes.

I believe in you.

Bart: Thanks, man.

-- pre-game pep talk, ``Dead Putting Society''



Hey Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and

we can't <both> win.

-- Homer, ``Dead Putting Society''



Ned explains that they were merely praying that no one gets hurt.

(At a golf tournament?)



Homer: This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels!

Ned: Nope, <you> will.

Homer: 'Fraid not.

Ned: 'Fraid so!

Homer: 'Fraid not.

Ned: 'Fraid so!

Homer: 'Fraid not infinity!

Ned: 'Fraid so infinity plus one!

Homer: D'oh!

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Todd tees of first and sinks a hole-in-one. Bart says to himself, ``Tree

falling in the woods... Tree falling in the woods... Tree falling in

the...'' He putts without looking. And sinks a hole-in-one.

The battle continues to the final hole.



If one looks up courage in the Oxford English Dictionary, one might very

well come upon a photo of these two gladiators. They approach the final

hole in the shadow of the Great Emancipator, deadlocked at eight strokes

on the happy side of par. Soon, one man will emerge triumphant; he will

drink naught but champagne, while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in

this oft cruel game.

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



Todd's putt lands a few feet from the hole. Next up is Bart.



Homer: Remember what Vince Lombardi said:

If you lose you're out of the family!

Marge: Homer! [slap]

Homer: Ow.

-- words of encouragement during the golf match, ``Dead Putting Society''



The ball heads for the obstacle. All gasp as it appears it won't make

it through. Then all breathe a sigh of relief when it does. Bart's

ball lands about the same distance from the hole as Todd's.



Bart: This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd.

Todd: Yeah, my knees are shaking, I got butterflies in my stomach...

But I guess this builds character.

Bart: Who wants to build character? Let's quit!

Todd: Okay.

-- ``Dead Putting Society''



The two pick up their balls and announce that they wish to declare the

match a draw. After a brief consultation of the rule book, the judge

agrees.



This is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since

Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs.

-- Tearful announcer, ``Dead Putting Society''



Bart and Todd are each presented with a novelty check for $25.

Ned is relieved that the bet is off, but Homer sticks to the letter

of the bet: Since Todd didn't win, Ned has to mow the lawn. Ned

reminds Homer that he must do the same, and Homer says it's a small

price to pay.

As a crowd of onlookers cheer and hoot, Ned and Homer mow each other's

lawns wearing their respective wives' Sunday dress. The other family

members look on embarrassed. (Except for Bart, who seems to be enjoying

it.)



Mm. My best dress...

-- Marge watches Homer mow the lawn in her Sunday dress,

``Dead Putting Society''



Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?

-- Lisa watching Homer mow the lawn in Marge's dress, ``Dead Putting Society''



Homer is profoundly humiliated, but Ned chuckles, the situation reminding

him of the stunts from his college days. Moans Homer, ``Oh my God, he's

enjoying it!''

The family fit, with Maggie in Marge's 'do.





At Moe's Tavern, the gang beg Homer to tell his story...



Homer: There's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one

of those guys who sits in a bar telling a story of how he became

a loser, and I never want that to happen to me.

Barney: Please, Homer?

Moe: Yeah, come on, Homer.

Homer: Well, okay.

-- Homer becomes one of those guys who sits in a bar telling a story of

how he became a loser, ``Dancin' Homer''



The story begins at `Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More

Than Three Children Night', at Springfield War Memorial Stadium to

watch the local minor-league team, the Springfield Isotopes, known

as the 'Topes to its fans...



[police sirens wail in the distance] \\

Heh, I think we lost 'em. Hey, and we're at the ballpark! Awright!

Two birds with one stone!

-- Otto drives the bus to the ballpark, ``Dancin' Homer''



pull back to see the huge set of skid marks leading up to the bus.

Heading into the stadium...



Homer: You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it

to the big leagues someday.

Bart: What? Aren't we going to see any washed-up major-leaguers?

Homer: Sure! We get a nice mix here.

-- At the ballpark to watch the local minor league team, ``Dancin' Homer''



Lisa looks forward to seeing poetry in motion, but Homer looks forward

to the 72-ounce tubs of beer.



Marge: Last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.

Homer: Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the

right, no, the duty! to make a complete ass of myself.

Marge: Mph.

-- At the ballpark to watch the local minor league team, ``Dancin' Homer''



At the gate, Mr. Burns greets each family as it arrives.



Burns: Ah, the Gammels. Good to see you.

Mr.G.: You're an inspiration to all of us in waste management, sir.

Burns: Well, take your mind off contaminants for one night and have a hot dog!

[laughs]

-- Out of the frying pan... ``Dancin' Homer''



Burns: Ah, well, if it isn't the Simps!

Homer: Uh, it's Simp-son, sir.

Burns: Eh? [refers to the index card] Oh, yes. Homer and Marge Simpson.

Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa, and uh, `expecting'.

-- At Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night

``Dancin' Homer''



At the stadium, Flash Baylor doesn't sign a baseball for Bart, so

Marge angrily takes the ball and approaches him. She returns with the

ball...



Marge: Here you go, Bart.

Bart: [reads the inscription] Springfield Kozy Kourt Motel, Room 26,

How about it? -- Flash.

Homer: Wow! Flash Baylor came onto my wife! You've still got the magic,

Marge.

-- Marge gets a baseball autographed, ``Dancin' Homer''



Homer appears on `Jumbo-Vision', and is embarrassed to find that his

zipper is undone.



Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out tonight's first ball,

the man whose name is synonymous with our nation's safest

and cleanest energy source, Mr. Montgomery Burns!

[isolated smatterings of applause]

Smithers: Oh, they love you, sir.

-- At the ballpark, ``Dancin' Homer''



Burns only manages to throw the ball two feet and is taunted by Homer,

Bart, and even Lisa. The National Anthem is sung by Bleeding Gums

Murphy...



Oooooooooooooooooooooh say. \\

Can you, \\

I'm asking you, \\

can you seeeeeeeeee \\

[huge sigh of relief from crowd]

-- The Star Spangled Banner, spangled by a star, ``Dancin' Homer''



... and Lisa is the one one who manages to stay awake for all of

it. The game between the Springfield Isotopes and the pesky Shelbyville

Shelby-Villians begins, the 'Topes hoping to snap a record 26-game

losing streak. Burns is shown to his seat...



Ah, sitting with the employees. I guess this proves I'm their friend.

Tsk, get me something on an aisle, Smithers, I don't want to be

<surrounded> by them...

-- Monty Burns joins his employees at the ball game, ``Dancin' Homer''



... which is right next to Homer. The two smile nervously at each other.

Homer bemoans his fate. Burns orders a tub of beer for himself and

Homer.



Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?

-- Homer suspects a trap when Burns buys him a beer at the ball game,

``Dancin' Homer''



The cost of two 72-ounce tubs is $2.50. The game continues,

and Homer and Burns join in taunting the players, and doing `the wave'

(which looks pretty stupid with only two people). It's now the bottom

of the ninth. One out, the bases are loaded, and the 'Topes are down

by three. The batter strikes out (``of course'').



Big Bill McCloskey coming up. As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the

post-game show.

-- Dan Horde calls the game between the 'Topes and Shelbyville,

``Dancin' Homer''



To the music of `Baby Elephant Walk', Homer dances on the dugout and

fires up the crowd, to the embarrassment of his family. (Lisa covers

Maggie's eyes, as well as her own.)



And I got up in front of them. I felt an intoxication that had nothing to

do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle!

-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''



And it works. McCloskey belts a homer out of the park to win the game.

But Homer's antics earn him a `banned for life' stamp on his index card.

In the parking lot, a shadowy figure approaches Homer. It's Antoine

Tex O'Hara, the owner, who hires Homer as the team's mascot.

[End of Act One. Time: 9:22] [pretty long]

Homer is decked out in his goofy `Dancin' Homer' outfit and drags the

family away from dinner to go to the game.



Our lives have taken an odd turn.

-- Lisa comments on Homer's goofy costume as... ``Dancin' Homer''



Homer: Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos!

Lisa+Bart: All right!

Marge: [disapprovingly] Mmm.

-- Homer takes the kids to the ballpark dressed as... ``Dancin' Homer''



At the park, Homer is a hit.



For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me,

they were laughing <towards> me!

-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''



The 'Topes win a second game, and Homer eventually gets top billing on

the signage.



A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day...

-- Marge reacts disapprovingly to Homer's likeness on a T-shirt,

``Dancin' Homer''



Homer tries to cast a spell on an opposing player, and gets threatened.

He asks the organist to play `Baby Elephant Walk' with a reggae beat.

And two long-haired Caribbean types express their approval. It's the

bottom of the ninth, the bases are loaded, and there are two outs...



S! P! R! I! N! G! F! E! E! L! D!! Springfield!!!!!

-- Homer spells out the town name while dressed as... ``Dancin' Homer''



But it doesn't help; the 'Topes lose. Homer is called to Tex's office

and is informed that he's going to be promoted to the big leagues, to

fill in for the Capital City Goofball a couple innings a night.



Tex: Why don't you talk it over with your family?

Homer: Because they might say no.

-- Homer learns he's being promoted to work for the Capital City team,

``Dancin' Homer''



This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced.

I should've listened to the kids instead of my big, dumb wife.

Oh, I shouldn't have called her that.

Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. Mmph. Ow!

-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''



He tells the family...



Lisa: I can't leave Springfield!

I was born here and I thought I would die here!

Homer: It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.

-- On moving to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''



Bart fears losing his friends, but Homer says he'll make new ones.



We're simple people with simple values. Capital City is too big and

too complex. Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us.

-- Lisa lists some reasons not to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''



But Marge tells Homer that this may be his calling in life and he should

go for it. The kids are won over.



Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger!

-- Lisa (quoting Nietzsche) agrees to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''



Even Maggie raises her arms in triumph. Homer asks his supervisor for

a leave of absence.



Sure, what would you like? Four years? Five years.

-- Homer's supervisor grants him a leave of absence, ``Dancin' Homer''



The family holds a yard sale, and Ned has trouble finding the right words...



Ned: I don't know how to say this, but uh...

Homer: Oh, knock it off, Flanders; don't start blubbering on me.

I'll miss you too... [aside] not.

-- Homer prepares to move to Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''



In the treehouse, Bart and Milhouse seal their bond as `spit brothers'.

(``Ewwww...'')



Lisa: I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other

better, my leaving would actually have meant something.

Friends: Yeah.

-- Lisa bids farewell to her classmates, ``Dancin' Homer''



Marge bids farewell to her sisters, and Homer gives a tearful farewell

speech to his fans at Homer Appreciation Night.

[End of Act Two. Time: 14:42]

The car is packed, and the family drive to Capital City. They arrive

at night and are awed at being in the city. They admire the sights...



Kids, look! Street crime!

-- Homer drives the family through Capital City, ``Dancin' Homer''



then check into the Come Back motel for the night. Homer practices his

spelling, but Marge tells him to come to bed. ``We would talk about it

always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.''

At the stadium, Homer goes in the ``Players-Mascots Entrance'', while

Marge and the kids get their tickets for the players' wives section.



Bart was strangely quiet. Later, he explained he was confused by feelings

of respect for me. It wouldn't last.

-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''



Homer talks to the Capital City Goofball (``If there's anything I can do

for you, just squeeze the wheeze'' [squeezes his nose, which honks]),

and learns he's going to be doing the fifth inning.



Goof: What exactly do you have planned for us?

Homer: Well, I get up and dance, and I spell out the name of the city,

all to the tune of `Baby Elephant Walk'.

Goof: Ah, Mancini. The mascot's best friend.

-- Homer and the Capital City Goofball plan their strategy, ``Dancin' Homer''



On his way out, Goof bumps into a hanging lamp.



Well, hello again, everybody. Dave Glass talking at ya.

We've got great weather here tonight, under the dome...

-- Calling the baseball game, ``Dancin' Homer''



Marge and the kids get seats in the upper-upper-upper-mezzanine, and it's

not the players' wives section; it's the players' ex-wives section.



Homer: [narrating] I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of

concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.

Vendor: Red hots! Getcher red hots here!

Homer: Ooh, red hots!

-- ``Dancin' Homer''



The spotlight shines on Homer, who quickly scarfs down his hot dog and beer,

then launches into his act. But he's a total flop. He is called into

the owner's office, who fires him. (``And for God's sake, put some clothes

on.'') The family wait depressed outside the ``players-mascot'' entrance,

but they put up a good front for Homer when he comes out.



Oh, what a family. My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home, I

realized how little that helped...

-- Homer narrates his story, ``Dancin' Homer''



And that's the story. Homer is amazed that everyone was hanging on his

every word. The bar denizens beg Homer to tell it again, and he agrees.

``I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more

popular.'' Moe responds, ``I dunno. They just do.''

[End of Act Three. Time: 20:27]

Over the closing credits, Tony Bennett sings the `Capital City' song.

\Q

{\bf Local baseball teams give inspiration to Simpsons}



Fans of The Simpsons may have noticed an eerie local flavor in last

Thursday's episode on the Fox Network.



For those who didn't see the episode, Homer, the gruff but lovable

patriarch of the Simpsons' household, was the mascot for the local minor

league team. His name was `Dancing Homer'.



`Dancing Homer' was so good at the local minor-league stadium, he made the

jump to the Major Leagues. The major league team was owned by Dave

Rosenfield, as in the Tidewater Tides general manager. There were also

references to Dave Glass, the Tides' former radio man, and there was a

player on the minor-league team named Flash Bailey as in Lash Bailey,

former Peninsula Pilot. \Note1



It turns out the episode was written by Ken Levine, who for two years has

done some radio work for the Tidewater Tides.\Note2 Levine is a former

writer for the Emmy-award winning Cheers. \Note3



According to Rosenfield, Levine hinted he would use Rosenfield's name in

an upcoming episode. Later, Rosenfield was told to watch Thursday's

episode. His wife taped it for him.



``I had a bunch of calls on it,'' Rosenfield said. ``People saw it and

thought it was interesting. Funny thing about it is people always say,

`Ordinarily I don't watch the Simpsons but I just happened to watch it

Thursday.' ''



Rosenfield was somewhat a bad guy in the episode. He fired Homer Simpson.



``I haven't fired a mascot in my whole life, primarily because I haven't

hired one,'' Rosenfield said with a grin. ``I only fire assistant general

managers.''



Rosenfield admitted he's not a big fan of The Simpsons, having now watched

it just twice. Frankly, he doesn't find it funny. Rosenfield said he smiled

once during the Thursday's episode. ``I know it's a very successful show

and an awful lot of people like it,'' Rosenfield said. ``I'm just not one

of them. I don't like The Simpsons.''

\eQ

Mr. Miller concludes, ``Mr Rosenfields' opinions about The Simpsons are fine

with me. I don't like the Tidewater Tides. So if you can believe what you

read in the newspaper, this is the story behind the baseball episode of The

Simpsons.''



\Note1 Actually, the character's name was Flash Baylor.



\Note2 Ken Levine is now the announcer for the Seattle Mariners.



\Note3 Ken Levine and David Isaacs always work together as a team.

They wrote 28 `Cheers' episodes together, and earned two Emmy

nominations for their work. (They didn't win, though.)



\Note4 Oh, and by the way, the Tidewater Tides are the farm team for

the New York Mets, if you cared.

As they set out on their journey, the family pass a sign that

The Capital City Song

Lyrics by Jeff Martin, performed by Tony Bennett, and punctuated

by the Simpson.

\Q \let@\smallskip

\: [Homer: Well, kids, there it is! Capital City!] \par

\: [Marge: Look, the Cross-Town Bridge!] \par

[begin vamp] \par

\: [Bart: Wow!] \par

\: [Homer: Wow.]

@

There's a swingin' town I known called... Capital City.

@

\: [Lisa: The Penny Loafer!]

@

People stop and scream hello in... Capital City.

@

\: [Homer: Kids, look! Street crime!]

@

It's the kind of place that makes a bum feel like a king.

@

\: [Homer: Wow, that's service!]

@

And it makes a king feel like some nutty, cuckoo, super-king.

@

\: [Marge: Look, it's Tony Bennett!] \par

\: [Tony: Hey, good to see you.]

@

It's against the law to frown in... Capital City.

@

You'll caper like a super-clown when you chance to see...

@

[Marge: Fourth Street and `D'!]

@

... Fourth Street and `D'! Yeah!

@

Once you get a whiff of it, you'll never want to roam.

@

[Homer: The Duff brewery!]

@

Capital City, my home sweet, yeah! \par

Capital City, that happy-go city, \par

It's Capital City, my home sweet swingin' home!

@

\: [All: Capital City! Yeah!]

\eQ

The song was also performed during the closing credits, but our local

affiliate decided that hyping `Beverly Hills 90210' was more important

than hearing Tony Bennett. Anyone care to check if there were any

new verses?



The location of Capital City

Theron Stanford @{tws} notes...

\Q

Capital City seems to be a synthesis of a number of large American

metropolitan areas. The ``crosstown bridge'' is a parody of SF/East Bay,

as well as perhaps NY. Also, Capital City has two restaurants named

``The Penny Loafer'' and ``The `Original' Frenchie's''. In Los Angeles,

there used to be a restaurant called ``The Brown Derby'' which indeed

was in the shape of a hat. And there still is a hamburger stand on

Beverly and Rampart called ``The Original Tommy's''. They have a number

of affiliated stands, as well as a few copycats such as ``Tom's Number 5'',

hence the epithet ``original''.

\eQ



The Capital City baseball team

In the locker room @{dh}

* The `Playdude' pin-up in one of the lockers. (cf. [7[FG]02])

* Pan shot of locker room shows one of the players placing a cake on

the seat of another player (playing poker), who is about to sit down.

Another player is placing a sharp object (tack?) under the seat of the

player who's placing the cake under the other player, while yet another

player is testing the flexibility of a towel behind that player. Off

camera, you hear the sound of a crack and a yelp.



What happens on the field as Homer waits for his big break @{jdc}

The right fielder catches a foul pop up and lands right next to Homer.

Everyone runs out on the field for a fight (one guy pops up in the air).

The Goof Ball rides by on a bicycle.



Antoine Tex O'Hara

Eric Jablow @{ej} points out: For many years, New York's WABC-TV evening

news had a popular weatherman, Tex Antoine. Tex had been around for 20

years or so, but he self-destructed in a gruesome way. In the mid-70s,

his spot came up just after a report of a rape case. Tex thereupon said

about the last story, ``Confucius says, `If rape be inevitable, just lie

back and enjoy it.' '' This so-called joke got him first suspended, and

then fired. [The incident was a major news story at the time. Whether

this is an intentional reference or just a coincidence is still

unresolved. --rjc]



Production notes

Dave Hall @{dh} notes that at the end of the story, the mugs are still

full of beer. The reason is that the decision was made late in the

production process to use Homer's narration as a frame around the

entire story. By then, it was too late to produce new animation for

the framing bits. That's why the lip sync is off for all the narration

scenes except for the one at the very beginning.



Random comments

Since this episode was a flashback, there is no inconsistency with

Mr. Burns having an outdated index card on the Simpsons, though it does

conflict with their banishment from all company outings in ``There's No

Disgrace Like Home''. Apparently, Homer was forgiven after his mascot

escapades.



Homer and Burns drank three 72oz tubs, which comes out to 18 beers each,

3/4 of a case! Burns must have set a world's record for blood alcohol

level since he only weighs about fifty pounds. @{ptb}

Not Just Another Flag

Springfield's state flag has three horizontal bars: green, white, and red,

with a blue star, with the motto ``NOT JUST ANOTHER STATE'' in the red

part.



It looks like it might be inspired by the flag of Ghana (red, yellow,

green, black star), or Syria (red, white, black, two green stars).





The blackboard

For the 25-Jun-1992 airing, Bart's blackboard punishment was hastily changed

to read



\Q

\Bb{``Potato'', not ``potatoe''.} \\

\Bb{``Potato'', not ``potat} at cutoff.

\eQ



This change was prompted by a news story involving then-Vice President

Dan Quayle (R--Indiana), in which, on a visit to a school, he corrected

a student's spelling of the word ``potato'' to include a nonexistent

silent `e' at the end. <I am not making this up.>



The coincidence of the repeat of this episode with the emergence of

H.\ Ross Perot, a rich businessman with no political experience, as

a serious presidential candidate was no doubt intentional.



Courtesy of Dave Murphy (djmurphy\@wam.umd.edu),

here's how the Washington Post reported the story (23-Jun-92):



\Q

Also at Fox yesterday, illustrators were busy making changes in the

introduction of this Thursday's repeat of ``The Simpsons'' in an effort

to help Bart ``make certain Vice-President Dan Quayle knows how to

spell `potato'.''



...



The opening of this Thursday's episode will find Bart at his familiar

blackboard writing over and over: ``potato not potatoe.''



Said a spokesman for the series, ``They are doing this specifically to

accommodate Mr. Quayle.''



Perhaps the vice-president can find some consolation in all this when

he learns that in the original opener for the episode Bart wrote on

the blackboard ``I will not Xerox my butt,'' which a producer conceded

yesterday ``was the crassest one we've ever done.''

\eQ

A tranquil scene by the lake. Lisa and Bart are fishing. A car pulls up.



Reporter: Ah. So, kids, caught anything?

Lisa: Not yet, sir.

Reporter: Uh huh. Uh, what are you using for bait?

Lisa: My brother's using worms, but I, who feel the tranquility

far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.

Reporter: I see. And what's your name, son?

Bart: I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?

Reporter: Heh heh. I'm Dave Shutton. I'm an investigative reporter who's

on the road a lot and, uh, I must say that in my day, we didn't

talk that way to our elders.

Bart: Well, this is my day, and we do, sir.

[catches something on the line, with appropriate `Hulp!' noises]

All right! We eat tonight!

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



But there is something strangely peculiar about the fish Bart catches.

It has one, two, three eyes. In the distance looms the twin cooling

Marge: Well, leave it to good ol' Mary Bailey to finally step in

and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.

Homer: [snort] Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find

better things to do with my time.

Marge: Like what?

Homer: Like getting Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's Birthday

back as separate paid holidays. `President's Day' [blows a

raspberry] What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out...

Marge: You're late for work, Homer.

Homer: So? Someone'll punch in for me.

Lisa: Try not to spill anything, Dad.

Bart: Keep those mutants comin', Homer!

Homer: [sotto voce] I'll mutant you...

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Homer arrives at work to find that only plain cake donuts are left.

The P.A.\ crackles to life.



Hi, ho, faceless employees.

-- Monty Burns greets his faceless employees,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Burns announces that a government inspection team is coming, so look busy

and keep your mouths shut. The inspectors arrive...



Hold me, Smithers.

-- Monty Burns, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Okay, men. Geiger counters on. [Geiger counters go crazy]

-- The nuclear power plant inspection,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower.

``D'oh. I'm as shocked as you are.''



Plutonium rod used as paperweight.

-- The nuclear power plant inspection,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



``D'oh. Now that shouldn't be.''

A drop of glowing green goo burns a hole through the

inspector's clipboard. ``Yeah, well, that's always been like that.''



Homer: [wakes with a start] Aa! [twiddling levers wildly]

Uh, just resting my eyes!

Burns: Ah, well-done. A rested employee is a vigilant employee.

-- The nuclear power plant inspection,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The inspectors stand in knee-deep glowing green water.

The chief inspector is taken to Burns' office.



Inspector: Mr. Burns, in twenty years, I have never seen such a shoddy,

deplorable...

Burns: Oh, look! Some ... careless person has left thousands and

thousands of dollars just lying here on my ... coffee table.

Uh, Smithers, why don't we leave the room, and hopefully, when

we return, the pile of money will be gone.

[leaves, waits, then returns]

Ooh. Look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are

still here.

Inspector: Burns, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying

to bribe me.

Burns: Is there some confusion about this?

[thrusting the money into the inspector's pockets]

Take it! Take it! Take it, you poor schmo!

-- The nuclear power plant fails inspection,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The inspector presents Burns with a list of 342 violations.



Burns: How much could it possibly cost to fix this place up?

Smithers: Approximately fifty-six million dollars, sir.

Burns: Fifty-six million!

Smithers: [cowering] Don't hit me, sir.

-- The nuclear power plant fails inspection,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Burns sends Smithers out, then hits the bottle. Time passes from 5:00 to

9:30, and Burns is obviously drunk. He sings ``Brother, Can You Spare

a Dime'' as he trudges down the empty corridors. Burns tosses the empty

bottle aside with a clatter.

The noise wakes Homer, asleep at his post. Realizing the lateness of the

hour, Homer phones home. ``Sorry I didn't call, but it's been a madhouse

here!'' In the parking lot, Homer hears Monty Burns' voice singing

from his luxury car. He peeks into the window, and the two are startled by

each other. Monty invites Homer in...



Ooh! Cushy!

-- Homer sits in Monty Burns' car,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



... and explains his predicament. Homer

recalls how he was talking to Marge about how <he> would run things if

he were governor...



Burns: Do you realize how much it costs to run for office?

More than any honest many could afford!

Homer: I bet <you> could afford it, though.

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Monty likes the idea. He drives off. ``Where are we going, sir?''

``To create a new and better world.'' ``If it's on the way, could you

drop me off at my house?''

[End of Act One.]



Marge: Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.

Homer: Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her.

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Ooh, a political discussion at our table. I feel like a Kennedy!

-- Lisa, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Marge can't see how a despicable man like Monty Burns has a chance

against Mary Bailey, ``the most belov\'ed governor our great state has

ever known.''

Monty Burns has called a meeting.



Now, here's the problem as I see it.

While Governor Bailey is belov\'ed by all,

ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse.

-- Monty Burns' political advisor,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The advisor introduces a few of his staff.



Advisor: Their job is to turn this Mr. Burns...

[shows standard portrait of Monty Burns]

... into this one.

[shows `artist's conception'.]

Burns: Why are my teeth showing like that?

Advisor: Because you're smiling!

Burns: Ah, excellent!

Yeah, this is exactly the kind of trickery I'm paying you for.

-- Monty Burns runs for office,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The advisor continues by introducing the other half of his team: The

people whose job it is to turn public sentiment against Mary Bailey.

``Ah, visual aids help so much.'' The first order of business is to

neutralize the fish story.

Grampa Simpson and friends watch television.



Thank you for watching `Movie for a Dreary Afternoon'.

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Coming next is a paid political announcement. Neither Abe nor Jasper

is willing to get up to change the channel, so they suffer through it.



An election!? That's one of those deals where they close the bars, isn't

it?

-- Barney, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Marge: I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.

Homer: Oh, Marge. What's the big deal?

I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion,

you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.

-- Watching Burns' campaign advertisement,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Thirty seconds to air.



Advisor: Now remember to smile.

Burns: [back to camera] I <am> smiling.

Advisor: You'll have to do better than that.

Burns: [grunt, grunt] How's this?

Advisor: There you go!

Burns [front view, showing very slight grimace]

Oh, I'm going to be sore tomorrow!

-- Preparing for his campaign advertisement,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



By the time this paid political announcement is done, every

Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating

out of my hands. [realizes the camera is on] Oh, hello, friends.

-- Monty Burns presents his campaign advertisement,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



He shows a fishbowl containing a three-eyed fish, named Blinky,

and assures the television audience that nothing is wrong.



But don't take <my> word for it.

Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin what <he> thinks.

-- Monty Burns presents his campaign advertisement,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



`Charles Darwin' presents his theory of natural selection.



So you're saying this fish may have an advantage over other fish.

It may be, in fact, a kind of `Super-Fish'!

-- Monty Burns presents his campaign advertisement,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Another absurd analogy later, Monty concludes...



This fish is a miracle of nature. With a taste that can't be beat.

[rubs his tummy] Mmm-mm!

-- Monty Burns neutralizes the fish story,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



``Only a moron wouldn't cast his vote for Monty Burns.''

-- Monty Burns' campaign song,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Wow! Super-Fish!

-- Barney, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



That Burns is just what this state needs: Young blood!

-- Abe, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Homer: I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.

Marge: Homer, I'm a Bailey Booster.

Homer: Oh, yeah? Well, <I'm> a Burns Booster.

[pins on a Burns campaign button] Ow!

-- Watching Burns' campaign advertisement,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Advisor: Congratulations, Mr. Burns, the latest polls show you are

up six points.

Burns: Ah, giving me a total of...

Advisor: Six.

-- Burns runs for governor,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Mary Bailey: My worthy opponent thinks that the voters of this state

are gullible fools. I, however, prefer to rely on their

intelligence and good judgement.

Reporter: Interesting strategy.

-- The gubernatorial campaign,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The campaign continues.



Marge's sign: An Independent Voter for Bailey

Lisa's T-shirt: I wish I were old enough to vote for Bailey.

Bart's T-shirt: My dad told me to vote for Burns.

Homer's sign: I'm a fool for Burns.

-- The family takes sides in the gubernatorial campaign,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Burns: Have you, uh, found any dirt on Mary Bailey?

Advisor 1: Well, we've gone through her garbage.

Advisor 2: We talked to her maid.

Advisor 1: And so far, the only negative thing we have found is

from some guy who dated her when she was 16.

Burns: Ah. And?

Advisor 2: He, uh, he felt her up.

Burns: Bah! Not good enough!

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Monty Burns gives a fiery speech.



Bart: Is your boss governor yet?

Homer: Not yet, son, not yet.

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The headlines read, ``Burns nukes Bailey in latest poll''.



Advisor: The voters now see you as imperial and god-like.

Burns: Hot dog!

Advisor: But there's a down-side to it.

The latest polls indicate you're in danger of losing touch with

the common man.

Burns: Oh, dear! Heaven forfend!

-- Burns runs for governor,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The night before the election, he should dine with one of his employees.

The advisors survey the security monitors in search for ``somebody

common enough.'' They see Homer eating a donut, scratching his butt,

and belching. Burns concedes, ``Well, I knew there would be sacrifices...''

[End of Act Two.]



Homer: Oh! Great toast, Marge!

Oh, by the way, the night before the election, Mr. Burns is

coming over for dinner.

Marge: What!?

Homer: Oh, and some reporters and a camera crew, but you don't have to

feed them.

Bart: Cool, man! A media circus!

Marge: Absolutely not!

Homer: Come on, Marge!

Marge: Mm mm. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.

Homer: D'oh! Kids, pleases leave the room. I don't want you to see this.

Bart: Uh-oh. [Bart, Lisa, and Maggie zip away]

Homer: [on his knees] Please please please please please please please

please please please...

-- The power of persuasion,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



The campaign crew plaster the Simpsons house with Burns posters.

(Even taking down the family portrait to make room.)



Advisor: Little girl, do you think you can memorize this by dinnertime

tomorrow?

Lisa: ``Mr. Burns: your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway

freight train. Why are you so popular?''

Advisor: Very good.

Lisa: Mm. Well, as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to

assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner

that may one day render it uninhabitable?

Advisor: No, dear. The card question'll be fine.

Marge: Well, I think the non-card question is a valid...

Homer: Marge! ... Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, and I'm sure

she'll be able to memorize your question by dinnertime tomorrow.

-- Preparing for Burns' visit as part a campaign publicity stunt,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Mr. Burns wants you to appear veeeery affectionate towards him.

But we must remind you, he hates being touched.

-- Preparing for Burns' visit as part a campaign publicity stunt,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



That evening in bed, Homer tries to snuggle up to Marge, who keeps

sliding away, until she falls onto the floor.



Homer: Marge, get back in bed.

Marge: [on the floor] No, I'm just fine right here.

Homer: What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.

Marge: I don't feel like snuggling.

Homer: What's that got to do with it?

-- Apparently, not much,

``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Marge explains that she doesn't want to snuggle with someone who doesn't

let her express herself. Homer explains that she <does> express herself,

through her housework and cooking. Marge takes to the idea, to Homer's

bemusement.

It's media circus time. The latest polls show a dead heat.

The guest of honor arrives, and is promptly bowled over by SLH.



Bad dog! Bad... neighbor dog!

-- Homer, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



He picks himself up, then is knocked down by Snowball II.

The family and Burns are seated at the dinner table. The advisor tells

Monty that the way he handled the pet incident has put him over the top.

Homer invites Bart to say Grace.



Dear God: We paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothing.

-- Bart says Grace, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Monty quickly covers. The family dig into their green glop (presumably

a salad) in a decidedly vulgar manner as Homer asks the prepared question.

Monty pretends the question was unexpected, then answers it in dramatic

fashion. As Marge clears away the dishes, Lisa reluctantly asks her

question, then leaves before Monty has finished answering it. Lisa joins

Marge in the kitchen to mope.



Lisa, you're learning many valuable lessons tonight. and

one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt.

-- Marge, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Marge carries the entree to the table: It's fish. Three-eyed.

Monty reluctantly hands over his plate, and Marge serves him the head.

Burns reluctantly takes a forkful, chews, then spits it out.

The piece of fish flies across the room. Cameras flash furiously,

and the media leave, all before the fish hits the floor.

Within minutes, word is out, and Monty's campaign is ruined.

His advisors throw in the towel.



YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! I'M CHARLES MONTGOMERY BURNS!

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Burns: [smashes some pictures] [tries to overturn a table, but can't]

Smithers, turn over this table for me.

Smithers: Yes, sir. [does so]

-- A friend in need, ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



Homer tries to intervene, but Burns snaps back, `Shut up and wreck

something!'' So Homer smashes a flowerpot. Lisa asks what the destruction

is going to accomplish, and Burns concedes the point.



Burns: This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the

election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one

to go to jail. That's democracy for you.

Smithers: You are noble and poetic in defeat, sir.

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''



``Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your

dreams will go unfulfilled.''



Homer: Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled? Oh, no! I don't like

the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing

to hope for. Marge, make it better please, can't

you make it better, huh?

Marge: Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on

dessert, occasional snuggling and sleeping in til noon on

weekends, no one man can destroy them.

Homer: Hey, you did it! [big smooch] [snuggling occurs and credits go up]

-- ``Two Cars in Every Garage, Three Eyes on Every Fish''

Paul McCartney on the tombstone is a reference to the `Paul is Dead'

hoax of 1969. (According to the hoax, Paul was killed in a car crash in

1966 and was replaced by an exact duplicate.)



Further, many Beatles songs supposedly featured ``clues'' to Paul's

demise. ``Number nine'' (Revolution #9) backwards says ``Turn me on,

deng men'' and the babble at the end of ``I'm So Tired'' backwards says

``ul is debneh, miss him, miss him, miss him.'' And the best clue,

``the Walrus *was* Paul'' from ``Glass Onion.'' According to the

rec.music.beatles FAQs, all four Beatles have vigorously denied any

connection to the hoax (I suppose Pete Best was unavailable for comment).



Misc

Matt Groening wanted the title for the Alien book to be ``How to Cook

for Forty Humans and then Eat Them,'' but it was vetoed.



For this capsule, the text of the Raven used is that which is listed by

the E.A. Poe Society of Baltimore as `T'. It was the last version printed

before Poe's death. The full poem may be found here:

On a stage, Marge pops out from behind a curtain.



Hello, everyone. You know, Hallowe'en is a very strange holiday. Personally,

I don't understand it. Mm mm... Kids worshipping ghosts, pretending to be

devils. Oooh, things on TV that are <completely> inappropriate for younger

viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother <my>

kids. But tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary.

So if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed

early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thanks for

your attention.

-- Marge's disclaimer, ``Treehouse of Horror''



``The Simpsons Halloween Special''. Thunderstorm. Pan across Springfield

Cemetery... Push in on the Simpsons' home, panning upward to the treehouse,

where Lisa's distinctive hairstyle can be seen in the window. Down below,

a sheeted ghost approaches. It's Homer, carrying a bag of treats.



Ooh, what a haul this year. I <love> Hallowe'en!

-- Homer returns from a night of trick-or-treating, ``Treehouse of Horror''



He spots the light on in the treehouse and investigates.

Inside, Lisa holds a flashlight to her face and concludes telling her

scary story to Bart and Maggie. Bart is hardly impressed and says it

wasn't scary. After a brief ``Is not!''/``Is too!'' argument, Lisa

hands Bart the flashlight and tells him to give it his best shot.

``Here's a story that's reeeeeeeeeeeeally scarifying.'' (``Oh, brother.'')

Bad Dream House Written by John Swartzwelder

Directed by Wesley Archer

==============================================================================

The mover finishes moving the Simpsons' stuff into their new mansion;

Bart and Lisa set to unpacking. Homer tips the moving man a dollar.

He grumbles, ``I'm glad there's a curse on this place,'' on his way out.

Marge wonder why they were able to buy the house for so little.



Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat...

-- Marge admires the family's new mansion,

``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Meanwhile, Bart unpacks. He removes a book and sets it down, which

mysteriously floats into the air and goes back into the box. Bart removes

the same book and sets it down, etc. Another book propels itself across

the room, hitting Lisa. Lisa accuses Bart of throwing the book.



House: Geeettt ooouuuttt...

Marge: What on earth was that?

Homer: Probably just the house settling.

-- The Simpsons buy a haunted house,

``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Marge carries pots and pans into the kitchen, which is dripping with blood.



Mm... This kitchen <certainly> could use a woman's touch.

-- Marge discovers a blood-covered kitchen in their new home,

``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



She discovers a swirling hole in the wall and calls Homer in.



Lisa: It looks like a vortex. A gateway into another dimension.

Homer: Oooh, a vortex. [takes an orange and tosses it in] Catch!

[the orange disappears with a pop]

Heeeeey! Pretty slick!

[a crumpled-up piece of paper comes back]

Lisa: [reads the message] ``Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.''

-- ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.

-- A message from the beyond, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



A cry for help is heard from the living room, where the family discover

Bart and Maggie suspended in midair, assorted objects flying about.

Homer pulls Bart down. ``Okay, boy. Let's see you talk your way out

of <this> one!'' Lisa shivers with fear.



Lisa: I can feel an evil presence in this house.

Marge: Evil!?

Homer: Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother.

-- First things first, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Marge tells the kids to get their coats; they're leaving right now.

The kids' coats magically float into their arms.



It's only natural there be <some> things wrong with an old house like this.

It's a fixer-upper!

-- Homer explains the family's new (haunted) house,

``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



``We get a bunch of priests in here...'' As Homer defends his position,

he floats into the air. Then falls twenty feet to the floor. Marge

reluctantly agrees to sleep on it. (The idea, not the floor.)

That evening...



House: They are all against you, Bart... You must kill them all...

They all must die...

Bart: Are you my conscience?

House: I... [pause] ... Yes, I am.

-- A conversation with the... ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Meanwhile, the house tells Lisa, ``Lisa... The butcher knife, Lisa...''

Lisa takes a butcher knife out of her drawer. (``Weird kid,'' observes

Chris Baird @{cjb}.) She tests its sharpness and grins evilly.

In his bedroom, Homer wields an axe. ``They are all against me... They

all must die...'' In her crib, Maggie sits up, and her head spins around.

In the kitchen, Marge reaches for a serrated bread knife...

Homer wanders into the kitchen, followed by Bart (cleaver), Lisa (butcher

knife), and Maggie (paring knife). Maggie holds the knife between her

teeth. The four march in a circle, laughing maniacally. In the kitchen,

Marge lowers her knife...

To spread mayonnaise on a sandwich. She emerges into the living room

and asks, ``What's going on out here!'' Everyone apologizes to each

other. (Maggie sucks apologetically.)



This family's had its differences, and we've squabbled,

but we never had knife fights before.

-- Marge, after the infamous knife scene,

``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Lisa opens the door to the cellar and discovers...



Lisa: It's an ancient Indian burial ground...

Bart: Man, this place has got everything!

-- ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer angrily dials the phone.



Mr. Bloot? Homer Simpson here. When you sold me this house, you forgot to

mention one little thing: YOU DIDN'T TELL ME IT WAS BUILT ON AN INDIAN BURIAL

GROUND! ... NO YOU DIDN'T! ... Well, that's not <my> recollection. ...

Yeah? Well, all right, goodbye! [angrily hangs up] He said he mentioned

it five or six times.

-- Homer, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Marge is about to leave.

-- A house that knows how to get its point across,

``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Marge finally blows up and gives the house a good tongue-lashing. She

then catches herself. ``My hands are shaking!'' Homer consoles her,

``Better than your eyes bursting. Ugh.''



Bart: Do it again!

House: What?

Bart: Make the walls bleed.

House: No!

Bart: Hey, man, we own you. Let's see some blood!

House: I don't have to entertain <you>.

Bart: Come on, man, do it. Do the blood thing. Come on, do it.

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!

-- Bart talks to the ... ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Meanwhile, Lisa takes a more sensitive approach. The house whines,

``Leave me alone...'' Marge steps in, ``Don't talk to her like that.''

The house rejoinds, ``Hey, listen, lady!'' Marge tells the house that

that will have to learn to live together. The house asks to think about

it, and the family step outside.



Hm... Life with the Simpsons. What choice do I have? [self-destructs]

-- The House, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



The house folds in on itself and explodes.



Bitchin'!

-- Bart watches the house self-destruct,

``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



It chose to destroy itself rather than live with us. One can't help but

feel a little rejected.

-- Lisa, ``Bad Dream House'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



The family trudge down the street.

[End of Act One]

Lisa is unimpressed, so Bart decides to show her... ``This severed finger!''

He opens a matchbook, revealing a severed finger. (Insert scary music.)

Maggie removes her pacifier and sucks on the finger. Bart quickly discards

the matchbox. (``Ewww! Baby spit!'')

``That was just a warm-up for this mock-a-bree tale which I call...''

==============================================================================

Hungry Are the Damned Written by Jay Kogen and Wal Wolodarsky

Directed by Rich Moore

==============================================================================

The Simpsons are having a barbecue on the back patio. Homer turns on the bug

zapper, then empties an entire can of lighter fluid into the grill. ``That

should just about do it.'' He tosses in a match. FOOM! A mushroom cloud

forms over the Simpsons house.

Lisa is the first to spot a flying saucer hovering over the backyard. All

investigate. (Homer eats a hamburger.) A shaft of orange light descends

and lifts one by one the members of the family into the saucer. (Though

it has considerable difficulty lifting Homer.)

A drooling, green, octopus-like alien introduces himself.



Alien: Greetings. I am Kang. Do not be frightened. We mean you no harm.

Marge: You, you speak English.

Alien: I am actually speaking Rigelian. By an astonishing coincidence,

both of our languages are exactly the same.

-- The Simpsons are abducted by aliens,

``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Kang explains, ``Kodos and I are taking you to Rigel IV, a world of

infinite delights to tantalize your senses and challenge your intellectual

limitations.''



Look, I know that to you, we Simpsons are a lower order of life.

We face that prejudice every day of our lives...

-- Lisa pleads for mercy from the aliens,

``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



But her plea is interrupted by a buffet cart. ``Take all you want, but

eat all you take.'' For Lisa, fried shrimp. For Bart, Sloppy Joe's.

For Homer, pork chops. And for Marge...



Radish rosettes! These are hard to make. They're a very advanced race.

-- Marge admires the aliens' food,

``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Kang, drooling, invites them to ``grow large with food.'' Lisa suspects

something isn't quite right, and Homer agrees. He orders applesauce.



Alien: [drooling] Your wife is quite a... dish.

Homer: Oooh, thanks.

-- ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



The family are shown to the entertainment center.



Alien: On this cable system, we receive over one million channels from the

furthest reaches of the galaxy.

Bart: Do you get HBO?

Alien: No, that would cost extra.

-- Showing the flying saucer's entertainment center,

``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Next, Kang shows the family video pong. The family scoff.



Alien 1: Anyone from a species that has mastered intergalactic travel

raise your hand. [raises his tentacle]

Alien 2: [raises his tentacle]

Bart: [raises his hand]

Homer: [slaps Bart's hand]

Alien 1: All right, then.

Marge: I'm sorry. Your game is very nice.

-- After the Simpsons chuckle at the `Pong' video game on the UFO,

``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Dinner is announced. Lisa asks why the aliens never eat, and they explain

that they are saving their appetite for a great feast that awaits them on

Rigel IV. Marge asks if they're invited. Kang answers, ``You'll be at the

feast. I have a feeling you'll be the Guests of Honor...'' The aliens

chuckle. Homer asks for more details, but Kodos explains, ``When we arrive,

there will be plenty of time to chew the fat...'' Lisa doesn't touch her

food.

While the aliens weigh Bart and Homer, Lisa explores. She discovers the

cook reaching for a spice rack. ``This will give the humans the perfect

flavor...'' He licks his lips and carries off the pot. Lisa looks at the

cookbook: ``How to Cook Humans.''

She rushes back to the dining room and shows the family her discovery.



Nobody, but NOBODY eats the Simpsons!

-- Homer, ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



(Homer's face is smeared with barbecue sauce.) Kodos takes the book and

blows off the dust. The real title is ``How to Cook <for> Humans.''

Lisa blows off more dust: ``How to Cook <Forty> Humans.'' Kodos blows

off yet more dust. The full title reads ``How to Cook <for> Forty Humans.''

The aliens are shocked and hurt that the Simpsons thought they were going

to eat them. (``Frankly, you people made pigs of yourselves.'') Serak the

Preparer cries.

The flying saucer returns the Simpsons to their backyard.



Alien: We offered you paradise. You would have experienced emotions

a hundred times greater than what you call love. And a thousand

times greater than what you call fun. You would have been treated

like gods and lived forever in beauty. But, now, because of your

distrustful nature, that can never be.

Marge: [aside] Mmmm. For a superior race, they really rub it in.

-- ``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Lisa poetically observes, ``There <were> monsters on that ship, and truly

we were them.''



Lisa, see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good?

-- Marge, after Lisa ruins things yet again,

``Hungry Are the Damned'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Bart chimes in, ``Way to go, Lis.'' Homer adds, ``Yeah, thanks, Lisa.''

[End of Act Two]

In the treehouse, Lisa reads a book. Bart chokes himself, trying to get

her attention. Lisa is reading ``a classic tale of terror by Edgar Allan

Poe.'' Bart suspiciously observes that she's reading a school book.

``Don't worry, you won't learn anything. It's called...''

==============================================================================

The Raven Written by Edgar Allan Poe and Sam Simon

Directed by David Silverman

==============================================================================

As Lisa reads, the scene changes to a scary mansion.



Lisa: Once upon a midnight dreary,[...]

Narrator: [...] while I pondered, weak and weary,

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore --

-- Lines 1-2 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer sits, asleep, with a book titled ``Forgotten Lore Vol.~II'' on his

lap.

When the tapping occurs in the next stanza, Homer wakes up with a start and

looks around nervously.



Narrator: While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,

As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door --

Homer: "'Tis some visiter,"

Narrator: I muttered,

Homer: "tapping at my chamber door --

Only this and nothing more."

Bart: Are we scared yet?

-- Lines 3-6 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer returns to sleep.



Narrator: Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;

And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.

Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow

From my books surcease of sorrow --

-- Lines 7-10 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer wakes up and walks to a tall portrait of Lenore (Marge), her hair

going up so far that it requires a second panel.



Narrator: sorrow for the lost Lenore --

Homer: [plaintively] Oh, Lenore...

Narrator: For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore --

Nameless here for evermore.

-- Lines 10-12 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



A rustle is heard outside. Homer screams and hides behind the chair.



Narrator: And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain

Thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;

So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,

-- Lines 13-15 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer hides under the chair.



Homer: "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door --

This it is and nothing more."

-- Lines 16,18 (17 omitted) of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Narrator: Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,

Homer: "Sir,"

Narrator: said I,

Homer: "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;

But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,

And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,

That I scarce was sure I heard you "

Narrator: -- here I opened wide the door; ----

Homer: [throws open the door and covers his eyes]

Bart: [impatiently] This better be good.

Homer: [peeks through his fingers]

Narrator: Darkness there and nothing more.

Homer: Huh?

-- Lines 19-24 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Sitting outside the treehouse is Homer, clearly scared. Bart complains,

``You know what would have been scarier than nothing?'' ``What?''

``ANYTHING!''



Narrator: Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,

Soon again I heard a tapping something<1> louder than before.

Homer: "Surely,"

Narrator: said I,

Homer: "surely that is something at my window lattice;

Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -- ["]

-- Lines 31-34 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer opens the window.



Narrator: Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,

In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;

-- Lines 37-38 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



The raven bears a striking resemblance to Bart.



Narrator: Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;

But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door --

Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door --

Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

-- Lines 39-42 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer chuckles.



Homer: "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"

Narrator: I said,

Homer: "art sure no craven,

Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore --

Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"

Narrator: Quoth the Raven

Bart/Raven: Eat my shorts!

-- lines 45-48 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Lisa tells Bart that the Raven says ``Nevermore'' and nothing else.

Bart reluctantly gives in.

An odor wanders past, and Homer catches a whiff of it.



Narrator: Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some<2> unseen censer

-- line 81 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



The `unseen' censer whaps Homer upside the head. (``D'oh!'')



Narrator: Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.

-- line 82 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



The seraphim in question are an angelic Lisa and Maggie.



Homer: "Wretch,"

Narrator: I cried,

Homer: "thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee

<3>respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;["]

-- lines 83-84 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''





Homer orates before the portrait of Lenore.



Homer: ["] Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"

Narrator: Quoth the Raven

Bart/Raven: "Nevermore."

Homer: D'oh!

-- lines 85-86 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer is really angry now.



Homer: "Be that word our sign of<4> parting, bird or fiend!"

Narrator: I shrieked, upstarting --

Homer: "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!

Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has<5> spoken!

Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door!

Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"

Narrator: Quoth the Raven

Bart/Raven: "Nevermore."

Homer: [trying to stay calm]

["]Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"

Narrator: Quoth the Raven

Bart/Raven: "Nevermore."

Homer: Why you little...!

Bart/Raven: Uh-oh!

-- lines 99-104 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer lunges for the Raven, who flits off. Homer chases the bird across

and around the room, but it remains barely out of reach.



Homer: Come back here, you little Raven!

-- An incidental moment of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer's chase makes a mess of his chamber.



Homer: D'ah, grf, son-of-a, d'oh!

-- An incidental moment of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Homer throws a potted plant at the Raven, who dodges the projectile. In

true cartoon fashion, the plant hits Homer on the head. Tiny Ravens dance

around Homer's head, chanting, ``Nevermore, Nevermore, Nevermore...''

The chase continues. The Raven plucks books from the shelf and drops them.

The Raven has returned to its place atop the bust of Pallas. Below lies

the carnage it has wrought upon the room.



Narrator: And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting

On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;

And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,

And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;

And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor

Shall be lifted -- nevermore!

-- lines 105-110 of ``The Raven'' in ``Treehouse of Horror''



Notes:

<1> Original says ``somewhat'', not ``something''.

<2> Original says ``from an'' not ``by some''

<3> Original has ``Respite -- '' at the beginning of the line

<4> Original says ``in'' not ``of''

<5> Original says ``hath'' not ``has''

The Raven chuckles evilly.

Fade back to the treehouse.



Bart: Lisa, that wasn't scary. Not even for a poem.

Lisa: Well it was written in 1845. Maybe people were easier to

scare back then.

Bart: Oh, yeah. Like when you look at ``Friday the Thirteenth, Part 1''.

Pretty tame by today's standards.

-- Lisa reads ``The Raven'', ``Treehouse of Horror''



Marge calls the kids to bed, and Bart brags that he won't have any trouble

falling asleep tonight. As the kids descend, we see Homer sitting outside

the treehouse, shivering.

Maggie, Lisa, and Bart all sleep soundly in their respective rooms. Homer

begs Marge not to turn off the light, with no success. Through the window,

he sees the Bart/Raven, which chuckles before flying away. ``Oh, I hate

Hallowe'en.''

Inside jokes

When Burns emerges from the bathroom stall in the executive washroom, he says

\Q

I was watching the DuMont last night, when I happened to catch a

fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox...

\eQ

Bill Morris reminds us that DuMont was one of the first companies

to produce television sets. But the pun is that back in the early

50's, DuMont had its own television network in competition with

the big three, much like what FOX is doing now. (DuMont went under

because they didn't have the resources to expand.) And to make sure

we get the joke, the documentary just happens to be about the Desert FOX.



What's more, the name of the man who defeated Rommel? General

Montgomery.



Is Karl a Homersexual?

Harvey Fierstein is a well-known gay actor. Does this carry over to

his character?



Marc Conte points out that there were some references to the Gay movement.

Karl says that a new suit should say, ``Don't judge me, love me!'', which

is a slogan seen at Pride marches. And Karl gets into high gear when he

gets Homer to go through an affirmation--Homer yells at the top of his

lungs that he is nature's greatest miracle, etc.



In `Do the Bartman', Jacques is dancing with a woman, who turns into Karl.



Gorilla man, for real!

Dr. David Gill gives us a brief history of minoxidil: Minoxidil is a drug

that originally was used for high blood pressure, but was found to have

excessive hair growth (all over) as a side effect. Someone thought to try

it topically to regrow hair and it was modestly effective, so is over

marketed as Rogaine. It is still used as a last line agent for high blood

pressure.



Andrew Gill gives us a little more information: in 1988, Upjohn marketed

minoxidil under the brand name Rogaine. It's now owned by Pfizer.

Apparently, many of the writers were losing hair and had heard of the

product, thus spurring the plot.



So why're you kissing Homer, then?

When Karl kissed Homer, it appears that he may have rocked Homer's world a

little more than Homer may have realized. It was the first time that a

man kissed another man romantically on network television. There was a

kiss between two women on L.A. Law, and certainly Homer kissed Bart in

[7G02], but the next time that two men would kiss like that in prime time

would be in 1999, on Dharma and Greg.



The Simpsons producers used the ``Elmer Fudd loophole''--since Bugs Bunny

used to kiss Elmer Fudd, they claimed that it's the same dynamic with

Homer and Karl.



Baldness is hereditary

Robert Lippman points out that Bart doesn't react to the fact that he's

ruined his father and his family. What scares him is that baldness is

hereditary. Of course, what Homer doesn't say (perhaps because he

doesn't know) is that male pattern baldness is sex-linked. You inherit

it from your mother, not your father.



Andrew Gill clarifies this: the gene for male pattern baldness is on the

non-homologous portion of the X chromosome, so there is no allele on the Y

chromosome that corresponds to this trait. The only possible way to get

the trait from your father is if he gives you an X chromosome, in which

case you are either a woman or have Klinefelter's Syndrome.



Misc, &c.

that union contract



So if Homer's going back to his old job, does that mean that Burns has

breached the union contract? Who will be the junior executive? The guy

smoking by the no smoking sign?



jiko kanri



According to Jeffrey's J-E dictionary, jiko kanri means something along

the lines of self-supervision. See the dictionary here.



The painting in Homer's office



Does anyone recognise it? I could swear I saw it in Janson's History of

Art, but I can't find it. It looks a little like the work of Giorgio de

Chirico in terms of setting, composition and color, but it doesn't seem

like his style.



= The package of floss changes color

= When Dr. Boyle tells Homer that his insurance won't cover dimoxinil, the

hair on the back of his head disappears.

= When Homer gets his job back, his chair disappears.

= The dimoxinil shouldn't have emptied below the neck of the bottle.

- During Patty's ``Look who's talking'', the animators mis-colored her

and Selma's necklines. For a brief while, their sundresses go up to

the neck.





Homer, Patty and Selma are sitting on the couch watching TV (with TV dinner

trays in front of them). Bart and Lisa are on the floor.



TV host: Okay, the capital of North Dakota was named for what German ruler?

Homer: Hitler!

Marge: [coming in with food] Hitler, North Dakota?

-- Hope springs eternal in Homer, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer pays a visit to the center, to find that it costs $1000.



We do have a product which is more in your price range. However, I must

assure you that any hair growth you experience while using it will be

purely coincidental.

-- ``Dr. H'', ``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer: [breaks down in tears] Of all the rip-off, screw job, chip joint...

[gets up] Forget you pal... [sobbing] thanks for nothing.

[leaves, crying]

[at the nuclear plant]

Homer: So I say, [angrily] Forget you, pal! Thanks for nothing!

And I storm right out of there.

-- A matter of perspective, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Dry fish-sticks! This sucks!

-- Homer complains about cafeteria fare, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Karl: Quit complaining, chrome-dome.

Homer: D'oh! If I had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that!

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



One of his co-workers suggests putting it on the company medical insurance,

figuring that all it will mean is that Burns won't be able to buy another

ivory back-scratcher.



Why should you get nothing, while some guy who loses a finger hits the

jackpot?

-- Len cajoles Homer into filing a false medical insurance form,

``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer pays ``Dr. H'' another visit. They arrange a shady deal in the alley.

Homer then follows the instructions, including the scalp massage while

hanging upside-down.



Dear God, give a bald guy a break. Amen.

-- Homer's hairful prayer, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer wakes up to find a full head of hair, and runs through town in

his nightgown, saying good morning to the Winfields, Moe's Tavern,



Homer: Good morning, Moe's Tavern!

Barney: Hey, it's the president!

-- Homer gets hair, ``Simpson and Delilah''



a funeral, and another man who is running through town doing the same thing!

He returns home to his loving family, then pays a visit to the barber.

Marge talks to her sisters...



Marge: Just between us girls, he hasn't been this frisky in years!

Patty: [grunt] I don't want to think about it.

Homer: [from offscreen] Daddy's home, sugar!

Marge: [goes offscreen to greet him]

Homer: Come here, you.. heh heh heh.

Marge: Oh, Ooh!

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



Patty: This is Homer? Oh, my!

Selma: [grunt] Patty, stop drooling.

Patty: Look who's talking.

-- Homer gets hair, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Burns surveys the security monitors...



Burns: None of these cretins deserves a promotion!

Smithers: It's in the union contract, sir. One token promotion from within

per year.

Burns: [indicating the security monitor] Wait, who's that young go-getter?

Smithers: Well, it sort of looks like [chuckle] Homer Simpson, only more

dynamic and resourceful.

Burns: Simpson, eh?

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



Attention Homer Simpson. You have been promoted. You are now an executive.

Take three minutes to say good-bye to your former friend and report to

room 503 for reassignment to a better life.

-- Smithers' PA announcement, ``Simpson and Delilah''



[End of Act One. Time: 6:15+]

Homer interviews for a secretary...



Well, your r\'esum\'e [pronounced ree-zoom] seems good enough...

-- Homer interviews for a secretary, ``Simpson and Delilah''



The next applicant, a man, comes in.



Karl: You don't belong here. You're a fraud and a phony, and it's

only a matter of time until they find you out.

Homer: Gasp! Who told you?

Karl: You did. You told with me with the way you slump your shoulders,

the way you talk into your chest, the way you smother yourself

in bargain-basement lime-green polyester.

-- Homer hires a secretary, ``Simpson and Delilah''



First order of business is a new wardrobe. The next morning, Marge

wishes Homer a happy anniversary, and Homer realizes he forgot <again>.

But Marge is surprised by a singing telegram (sent by Karl). At the

board meeting...



Smithers: Our first issue, sir, is our low productivity and record high

worker accident rate.

Burns: [expels breath] Any suggestions?

Advisor1: A round of layoffs might wake up the idiots.

Advisor2: We could put caffeine in the water cooler.

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



Burns: How would you improve the worker situation?

Homer: Well, sir, for one thing, we have a problem every Tuesday when

the cafeteria would serve fish sticks...

Burns: Fish sticks!? What in blazes are you talking about?

Homer: Well, sir, they cut the head off the fish, then chop up the rest of

the sticks [sic]. And then put seasoned breadcrumbs on it...

-- Haven't I heard this joke before? ``Simpson and Delilah''



Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!

-- Burns implements Homer's plan, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer's tartar sauce solution seems to have worked...



You know, sir, accidents decreased by exactly the number that Simpson himself

is known or suspected to have caused last month. And our output level is

just as high as during Simpson's last vacation.

-- Smithers, on Homer's promotion, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Burns is so impressed by Simpson's work that he gives Homer the key

to the executive washroom. While Homer pays it a visit...



Oh, hey ho, men. You know, I was watching the Dumont last night, when

I happened to catch a fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox...

-- Mr. Burns emerges from a bathroom stall, ``Simpson and Delilah''



When Homer becomes Burns' `favorite', Smithers gets mad and throws the

handtowel to the floor. (Upon which a man quickly dashes out, picks

it up, and backs away, somewhat like a tennis ballboy.) At night, Smithers

sneaks into the files and finds Homer's phony medical insurance form.



Hm... $1000? Dimoxinil? ``To keep brain from freezing''?

-- Smithers finds Homer's phony medical insurance form, ``Simpson and Delilah''



[End of Act Two. Time: 12:08+]

The Simpsons yard is loaded with toys, and Marge suggests that they save

some of it for a rainy day. ``Rainy day? There's never going to be

a rainy day, Marge!''



Homer: [kindly] And what does my little girl want?

Lisa: An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.

Homer: Uh... How about a pony?

Lisa: Okay!

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



Burns asks Homer to give an inspirational speech to the executives.

Smithers informs Burns of his discovery...



Smithers: One of your executives has bilked the company insurance plan

out of $1000.

Burns: What!? Blast his hide to Hades! [thunder roars outside]

And I was going to buy that ivory back-scratcher...

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



[Apparently, the Simpsons rainy day has come.] Smithers informs Homer

that he's been fired, but Karl takes the fall. Homer is at a loss

and watches Karl leave in the rain. When Karl realizes Homer forgot

his umbrella, he gives Homer his. While Homer panics on the drive home,

Bart dreams of having a beard and splashes the Dimoxinil on his face.

Homer returns, and Bart spills the bottle.



Homer: [strangles Bart] Boy... must... die!

Bart: I love you, Dad!

Homer: D'oh! [lets him go] Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not going to kill you,

but I'm going to tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the

rest of your days. You've ruined your father, you've crippled your

family, and baldness is hereditary!

Bart: It is!?

-- Bart spills the Dimoxinil, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer asks Marge if she has any money squirreled away and reaches into

her hairdo, but she stops him.



Dad is taking this in less than a heroic fashion.

-- Lisa observes Homer, reduced to blubbering when he realizes he's doomed,

``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer arrives at work the next morning and finds a note...



Homer: [picks up a note]

Karl's voice: Dear Mr. Simpson, I've taken the liberty of preparing your

speech on the enclosed numbered 3x5 cards.

All the big words are spelled phonetically

Homer: Phonanetically.

Karl's voice: God bless you. You are one of Springfield's very special

creatures. [camera pulls back to reveal Karl is standing there]

Your obedient servant, Karl. ... Good luck, sir.

Homer: [startles] Karl, so that <wasn't> just a sweet voice I heard inside

my head.

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



Karl tells Homer he succeeded because of himself, and not his hair.



Homer: I'm just a big fool.

Karl: Oh no, you're not.

Homer: How do you know?

Karl: Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool! [smack]

Homer: [somewhat surprised] Karl!

Karl: Now go get 'em, tiger!

Homer: [roar!]

Karl: [pats Homer's behind as he leaves]

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer presents his speech, sans hair.



Homer: [ahem] A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.

[burns a dollar bill]

Burns: He's crazy!

-- Homer gives a speech, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Some nerve, telling us how to run the plant. He doesn't even have hair!

-- Executive watches Homer's presentation, ``Simpson and Delilah''



They leave one-by-one...



[card #56 reads: ``And the long-term benefits more than offset the

one-time costs, for a net savings of $526,000.'']

Homer: And the long-term benefits more than offsetting the one-time costs, for

a net savings of... fuh, five thousand, two eh hundred and...

lots of money...

-- Homer's failed speech, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Homer is taken to Burns' office, but he doesn't fire him.



Burns: Simpson, how old do you think I am?

Homer: I dunno. A hundred and two?

Burns: [sadly] I'm only eighty-one...

-- Missed it by that much, ``Simpson and Delilah''



Burns recalls his own hairful days...



Burns: I'm giving you your old job back.

Homer: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

Burns: Now get out of here before I reconsider.

Homer: Oh. Better hurry up.

-- ``Simpson and Delilah''



In bed, Marge consoles Homer and sings ``You are so beautiful''.

This cheers Homer up.

Bart Gets an F

Written by David M. Stern

Directed by David Silverman

Bart seeks divine intervention when his deal with the class brain

fails to prepare him for a history test.



Blackboard

{I will not encourage others to fly.}



Couch

The couch falls through the floor.



... as Bart protested that they can't hold him back, Marge and Homer

were... holding him back?

... the computerized desks in Bart's dream?

... that all the mothers in Springfield wear strapless dresses?

... Ms. Krabappel had to <look up> the historical reference?

... Principal Skinner grabbing the still-cooly-dressed Martin

as Bart celebrates passing the test?

... Bart has an electric pencil sharpener?

... the nurse putting tongue depressors back in the jar?

... one point is the difference between passing and failing the 4th grade?

... Martin uses Zipp paint?

... Martin signs his graffito ``M. Prince?''

... the ``Give a Hoot...Read a Book'' poster in the nurse's office?



Yours Truly @{rjc}: Another classic. Bart a three-dimensional

character. Marge the consummate mother. (``Ooh, your third bowl!'')

Lisa precocious, but still with the eyes of a child. And Homer being

just plain Homer, rather than the exaggerated Homer-caricature of

later seasons.

The First Continental Congress

Stupid California textbooks. ``Could the delegates agree on

recommendations that all Americans could support?'' Yeah, right.

Typical Anglo-centric view of history.



Trailers

Bart's prayer scene was used in a FOX advertisement before the season started.

The scene was redubbed so that Bart said, ``Dear God, please make more people

watch us on Thursdays at 8. Especially women in the 18 to 35 age group.''

(Or something like that.)

The St. Louis Compact

Just in case you didn't know, the Pilgrims came over on the Mayflower. The

Spirit of St. Louis was the plane that Charles Lindbergh flew across the

Atlantic.



More Powerful than Mom and Dad and the Superfriends

I've heard tell that Channel 24 in St. Louis had a commercial for Jesus

during the Underdog Show that proclaimed that He was more powerful than the

Batman, Superman, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman COMBINED. Which got me

thinking--if we could convince the Wonder Twins to help out, then maybe...



Any information on this commercial would be greatly appreciated.



Miscellaneous

One guess how John Hancock was writing his name in the snow.





* When Gorilla the Conqueror throws the tree at the people, some of them are

already in the air at the exact moment of impact.

Springfield Elementary School. Martin completes his book report, titled

``An Afternoon With Ernest Hemingway: Reflections by Martin'', complete

with beard and fishing pole props. Ms. Krabappel gushes in admiration.

Bart slips a packet on Martin's seat. ``A little ketchup for your buns,

Papa?'' (*splort*) Next up is Bart.



Fellow students, prepare to be dazzled! [walks to the front of the room]

Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that I

read was <Treasure Island>. It's about these... [describing the book jacket]

pirates. Pirates... with patches over their eyes... and... shiny gold

teeth... and green birds on their shoulders... [pause]

Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Lewis Stevenson?

And published by the good people at McGraw Hill. So, in conclusion,

on the Simpson scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being

the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.

Any questions? [hands go up] Nope? Then I'll just sit down.

-- Bart's book report, ``Bart Gets an F''



Ms. Krabappel asks Bart if he actually read the book.



Mrs. Krabappel, I am insulted. Is this a book report or a witch hunt?

-- Bart takes offence when Mrs.K accuses him of not reading the book

he is doing a report on, ``Bart Gets an F''



She challenges him to tell the class the name of the pirate.

Bart thinks frantically to himself... ``Blackbeard... Captain Nemo...

Captain Hook... Long John Silver... Pegleg Pete... Bluebeard...''

He guesses Bluebeard. He guesses wrong.

After class...



I will not fake my way through life.

-- Bart's blackboard punishment, ``Bart Gets an F''



Ms. K: Your grades have gotten steadily worse since the beginning of the term.

Are you aware of that?

Bart: Yes, ma'am.

Ms. K: Are you aware that there is a major exam tomorrow on colonial America?

Bart: Yes, ma'am.

Ms. K: Blah blah, blah-blah. Blah blah blah blah blah?

Bart: Yes, ma'am.

Ms. K: Blah blah. Blah-blah blah, blah blah blah.

Bart: Yes, ma'am.

Ms. K: Bart! You haven't been paying attention to a word I said, have you.

Bart: Yes, ma'am.

Ms. K: Well, then what did I say?

Bart: Uhhhhhh... Straighten up and fly right?

Ms. K: Pah! That was a lucky guess.

-- Yes, ma'am, ``Bart Gets an F''



At the Noiseland Video Arcade, Bart plays (and loses) ``Escape from Grandma's

House''. Bart resolves, ``A couple more games, then I'll hit the books.''

He goes to the change machine and changes a $10 bill.

Bart (sipping a soda), Lisa and Maggie watch Itchy and Scratchy. The episode

has a French Revolutionary theme. Marge calls the family to dinner. Homer

rushes in before the icky skin forms on the soup. Bart resolves, ``Right

after dinner, it's down to business.''

At dinner...



Homer: Marge, could you get me another beer, please.

Marge: Just a second, Homer. Lisa has some good news.

Lisa: He doesn't care, Mom.

Homer: Sure I do! I just want to have a beer while I'm caring.

-- It's like walking and chewing gum, ``Bart Gets an F''



Lisa got an A on her vocabulary test. Homer proudly tapes the test to the

refrigerator, among the other vocabulary tests on the door, covering a crude

drawing labelled ``Cat'', drawn by Bart. Homer decides to pick up that beer

while he's there.

Homer remembers that it's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. Bart

tries to go study, but Homer yanks him into the living room. Homer and

Bart watch ``Gorilla the Conqueror'' together. ``Oh, well, maybe just

one more hour.'' The movie ends with the gorilla, in a cage, set adrift

at sea. Homer sobs, ``It's so unfair... Just because he's different.''

Bart leaves for his room to study.

Bart enthusiastically cracks open his history book. He tries reading

but dozes off.



Homer: Pssst. Marge, come take a look at this.

[Bart has fallen asleep at his desk]

Marge: Oh... the little tiger tries so hard.

Why does he keep failing?

Homer: Just a little dim, I guess.

-- Like father, like son, ``Bart Gets an F''



Homer and Marge put Bart to bed.

Bart wakes up the next morning. ``Uh-oh.''

Bart takes an open textbook on the bus...



Bart: [reading his history book while boarding the bus]

Otto: Hey, Bart-dude! Whoa, you look freaked!

Bart: Hey, Otto-man. I got a big test today I am <not> ready for.

Could you please crash the bus or something?

Otto: Oh-ho, sorry, little buddy. Can't do it on purpose.

But, hey! Maybe you'll get lucky!

-- ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart decides to find a seat next to an egghead, pump him for some answers,

and ``boom, back on Easy Street''. He selects Sherry and Terry. But

they see him coming and have a surprise in store.



Bart: Good morning, girls!

Sherry+Terry: Good morning, Bart!

Bart: Say... Who's up for a little cram session? I'll go first.

What was the name of the Pilgrims' boat?

Sherry: The Spirit of St. Louis.

Bart: [taking notes] And where'd they land?

Terry: Sunny Acapulco.

Bart: And why'd they leave England?

Sherry: Giant rats.

Bart: Cool! History's coming alive!

-- ``Bart Gets an F''



The girls giggle. Martin overhears the conversation.

As Bart gets off the bus, Martin (though he's not sure why he's doing it)

warns Bart that the answers the girls gave him were wrong. ``A blindfolded

chimp with a pencil in his teeth has a better chance of passing this test

than you do.''

In class...



Ms. K: All right, class, take one and pass the rest back. [hands out exams]

Bart: [to himself] Think, Simpson, think. Crisis brings out the best in you.

[convulses and collapses on the floor, moaning]

Ms. K: Ugh. What is it, Bart.

Bart: [climbing back to his seat] Nothing... Must... take... test...

[falls back to the floor]

-- Bart the Thespian, ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart leaves the classroom clutching his stomach. He dances through the

hallway, then resumes his histrionics when he reaches the nurse's office.

The nurse is on the floor picking up a dropped jar of tongue depressors.



Nurse: [concerned] What's the matter, son?

Bart: [clutching his stomach] Sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach.

Nurse: Oh dear, I've heard of this... [consults a medical reference book,

opens to the page ``Amoria Phlebitis'']

Do you feel a shooting pain in your arm?

Bart: [waving his arms] Both arms, ma'am.

Nurse: Temporary loss of vision?

Bart: [blindly] Huh? Who said that? Come closer...

-- Live from the Improv, ``Bart Gets an F''



In his bed, Bart finishes another bowl and rings a bell. Marge comes in,

and Bart asks for another dish of double-capuccino chocolate-fudge. Marge

is pleased that Bart seems to be recovering, since this is his third bowl.

Marge asks if there's anything else, and Bart asks for the TV set.

Marge calls downstairs to Homer (who is watching a gorilla movie),

``Bring the television up. Bart's got his vision back!''



I wish <I> had Amoria Phlebitis...

-- Homer, ``Bart Gets an F''



Lisa and Maggie join Bart.



Lisa: Everyone knows you're faking it, Bart.

Bart: Well, everyone better keep their mouth shut.

-- ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart calls Milhouse to get the answers to the exam.

Bart hums through the exam. Ms. Krabappel grades it on the spot.

``This test is worse than Milhouse's exam!'' This is the final straw.

Homer and Marge join Bart in the classroom.



Ms. K: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I think you know our district psychiatrist

Dr. J. Loren Pryor.

Homer: Hey, Dr. J.

Dr. J: [ahem] I think we have on our hands here a classic case of what

laymen refer to as fear of failure. As a result Bart is an

underachiever and yet he seems to be... How shall I put this...

proud of it?

Homer: Hmmm.

Dr. J: One of his problems may be his short attention span which can lead

to blah blah blah blah...

Homer: Uh-huh.

Dr. J: Blah blah blah, blah blah blah...

Homer: Mmmm...

-- Bart is close to failing fourth grade, ``Bart Gets an F''



Unlike the other students in the class, Bart has not shown any improvement

over the semester. Indeed, his grades have gotten worse. Bart cracks.

``Okay, okay! Why are we dancing around the obvious? I know it, you know

it. I am <dumb>, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?''

Dr. Pryor reluctantly recommends that Bart be held back. Bart protest,

but Marge suggests it might not be so bad. Bart continues his protests.



Look at my eyes! See the sincerity? See the conviction? See the fear?

-- Bart learns he might be held back a grade, ``Bart Gets an F''



As God as my witness, I can pass the fourth grade!

-- Bart, ``Bart Gets an F''



Adds Homer, ``And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the

other kids.''

[End of Act One. Time: 9:33] (Wow, a long one.)



Otto: Get off the bus or forever hold your peace, little dudes!

Bart: Otto, you know I respect you. I mean, you always let us throw

stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns.

Otto: Heh, damn thing never goes over, does it? [unintelligible

`ga-hah' noise] So what's in your head, little man?

Bart: Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently.

Otto: Yeah huh...

Bart: And, now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade

if I don't shape up.

Otto: That's it? Hey, relax, man! It could end up being the best thing

that ever happened to ya. I got held back in the fourth grade myself,

twice! Look at me, man! Now I <drive> the school bus!

-- ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart trudges into school.

In class, the phrase ``repeat the fourth grade'' echos through Bart's head

as he slips into a daydream. An elderly Ms. Krabappel asks an adult Bart,

``What was the pirate's name in <Treasure Island>?'' Bart responds, ``Look,

lady. I got a peptic ulcer, my wife's hocking me for a new car, and I need

a root canal. Willya quit buggin' me about the stupid pirate!'' Bart, Jr.

whispers the answer to his father, but Ms. Krabappel catches him and asks

to see them both after class.

Bart wakes up when a baseball bounces off his forehead. The ball rolls

over near Martin, who is seated under a tree reading. When Martin throws

the ball like a girl, the other kids laugh. Martin returns to the

forecastle of the Pequod. Bart gets an idea. He asks Martin to help him

pass.



Bart: I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.

Martin: They... laugh at me? I've always considered myself rather popular.

Bart: You're not. Watch. [pushes Martin down, crowd laughs]

Martin: But... but my speed with numbers... [Bart helps Martin to his feet]

my years of service as a hall monitor, my prize-winning dioramas?

These things mean nothing to them?

Bart: Perhaps another demonstration. [pushes him down again, more laughs]

-- ``Bart Gets an F''



Martin gets the point. Asks Bart, ``Then it's Adil?'' Martin agrees.

First order of business is to inspect Bart's study area. Bart shows Martin

to his room. ``There's a desk under that junk over there.'' Martin says

the room must be cleaned, and some ferns added.



No study area is complete without adequate plant life.

-- Martin, ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart and Martin get on the school bus.



Martin: [takes a seat at the front of the bus]

Bart: No!

Martin: No?

Bart: Only geeks sit in the front seat. From now on, you sit in the

back row. And that's <not> just on the bus, it goes for school and

church, too.

Martin: Why?

Bart: [mezzo voce] So no one can see what you're doing!

Martin: Ooooh.. I think I understand... [grabs pencil, starts writing]

the potential for mischief varies inversely with one's proximity

to the authority figure! [Shows his equation to Bart:

\math M \propto 1/P \math]

Bart: Well, yeah, but don't say it like that...

-- Bart helps Martin shed his poindexter image, ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart pops a wheelie on his bicycle. He then removes the basket from

Martin's bicycle, and Martin rides out of frame. (*crash*)

Martin adds a fern to Bart's shiny-clean room.

Bart teaches Martin how to shoot a slingshot, but the rubber band snaps

back in Martin's face.

Martin and Bart sit under a tree, reading a comic book and a history

book, respectively. Inside Bart's book is a comic book; inside Martin's

comic book is a textbook. Each looks at the other's book.

Bart finishes a ``Duh!''\ graffito and hands the spray can to Martin.

Martin produces an elegant mural of Ms. Krabappel at her desk. Bart

slaps his forehead.

Bart teaches Martin how to make funny faces.

Martin watches while Bart reads a book, highlighter pen in hand.



Pretty soon, you will be ready to try it with a <real> book!

-- Martin watches Bart with a highlighter pen and a `book', ``Bart Gets an F''



Milhouse, Lewis, Richard, Bart and Martin stop for breath after pulling

some unseen prank.



Who would have ever thought that pushing a boy into the girl's lavatory

could be such a thrill! The screams! The humiliation! The fact that

it wasn't me!

-- Martin joins Bart and friends, ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart reminds Martin about the history test, but Martin is too busy

having fun. ``Life's too short for tests!'' Martin leads the other

boys (except for Bart) to the arcade.

In his room, Bart doodles in his textbook. Marge pops in and reminds

Bart that it's past his bedtime. Bart reluctantly closes the book.

``This is hopeless.''



Bart: [praying] Well, old timer, I guess this is the end of the road. I know

I haven't always been a good kid, but, if I have to go to school

tomorrow, I'll fail the test and be held back. I just need one more

day to study, Lord. I need Your help!

Lisa: [watching] Prayer... the last refuge of a scoundrel.

Bart: A teachers strike, a power failure, a blizzard... Anything that'll

cancel school tomorrow. I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do

it, You can! Thanking You in advance, Your pal, Bart Simpson.

-- ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart turns off the light. Outside, snow begins to fall. A chorus sings

``Hallelujah!''

[End of Act Two. Time: 15:00]

Marge wakes Bart, who dreads the day. But Marge shows him the snow outside,

and Bart yells, ``Good morning, world!'' He takes the banister express

downstairs and joins the rest of the family listening intently to the radio.

Homer celebrates the closing of the nuclear power plant. Next, the school

closings. And yes, Springfield County schools are closed.

Kids rush out of their houses to enjoy the snow, followed futility by

their respective mothers being motherly.



Bart: [running towards door with sled; goggles on head] Cowabunga!

Marge: Remember to take a break if your arms go numb!

Bart: [rushes for the front door. Lisa's ominous shadow blocks the way] Hey!

Lisa: I heard you last night, Bart. You prayed for this. Now your

prayers have been answered. I'm no theologian; I don't know who or

what God is exactly, all I know is He's a force more powerful than Mom

and Dad put together, and you owe Him big. [shuts the door]

Bart: You're right. [removes goggles, hands them to Lisa]

I asked for a miracle, and I got it. I gotta study, man!

[goes upstairs to his room]

I'm not missing anything... frozen earlobes, trudging up that

stupid sledhill over and over again... How good could it be?

[looks out window...]

-- ``Bart Gets an F''



Outside, kids have a snowball fight. Milhouse takes a ride on a sled.

Kids build a snow fort. Marge takes the girls out ice skating.

Also on the ice are Ms. Krabappel and Principal Skinner, playing

hockey. Says Ms. K, ``I haven't had this much fun in years!''

Monty Burns walks past in period clothes, and a stray snowball knocks

off his top hat. Homer chuckles from behind a wall. Monty is a good

sport about it.



Burns: I was never one to back away from a snowball fight!

Smithers, you may fire at will!

Smithers: Certainly, sir.

-- Snow Day, ``Bart Gets an F''



Smithers pegs Homer in the noggin.

A band plays. Diamond Joe Quimby speaks.



I hereby declare this day to be Snow Day, the funnest day in the history of

Springfield!

-- Diamond Joe Quimby, ``Bart Gets an F''



People hold hands and sing carols.

Bart peels his face away from the window and goes into the basement.

He reads about the First Continental Congress. Bart envisions himself

seated among the delegates.



Th. Jefferson: We hold these truths to be self-evident...

Bart: [to himself] We hold these truths to be self-evident...

We hold these truths to be self-evident...

Th. Jefferson: That all men are created equal.

Bart: [to himself] That all men are created equal...

Th. Jefferson: And from that equal creation they derive rights inherent

and inalienable...

Delegate: [glances out the window, points]

Hey, look, everybody! It's snowing!

Delegate: In the middle of July?

Al. Hamilton: It's a miracle!

Ben Franklin: [comes in, shakes snow off his wig]

Fellas, I've invented something fun! The sled!

[all the delegates (except Bart) rush outside to play]

Delegate: [o.s.] Hey, look everybody!

John Hancock's writing his name in the snow!

-- Trying to study during a snow day, ``Bart Gets an F''



Bart shuts the textbook in horror. He stares at his chewed pencil.



You wanna be held back a grade? Concentrate, man!

-- Bart, slapping himself, trying to study, ``Bart Gets an F''



Through the cellar window, the rest of the family watch Bart slap himself.

(*slap*) Bart slaps himself in class after the exam is over. Martin

calmly turns in his test, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and wearing shades.

Bart answers the final few questions as Ms. Krabappel asks him to turn

in his exam. She pulls out `Old Red' and grades the exam as Bart watches

sadly, cringing at every X-mark. Bart got a 59, another F. Bart can't

believe it. Neither can Ms. Krabappel. ``Another year together. Ugh,

it's going to be hell.'' Bart stares at his exam and cries. Ms. Krabappel

doesn't understand, ``I figure you'd be used to failing by now.'' Bart

explains that he really tried this time, but it was no use. Ms. Krabappel

tries to reassure him, ``Well, a 59 is a <high> F...'' Bart complains,

``Now I know how George Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity

to the French in 1754!'' Ms. Krabappel is shocked. She looks up the

reference and announces, ``My God, Bart, you're right!'' She rewards

him with an extra point on his exam, bringing him up to a D-.



Bart: I... passed?

Ms. K: Just barely!

Bart: Gasp! I passed! I got a D-! I passed! [crying tears of joy]

All right! [kisses Ms. Krabappel and dances out of the classroom]

I passed, I passed, I passed, I passed! I got a D-! I passed!

[showing off his exam to anyone and everyone]

I got a D-! I passed! I got a D-! I passed!

I passed! I... ... ... kissed the teacher! Yuck! Ptuu! Ick!

-- Bart rejoices when he passes his test, ``Bart Gets an F''



Homer tapes Bart's test on the refrigerator.



Homer: We're proud of you, boy!

Bart: Thanks Dad. But part of this D minus belongs to God...

-- Posting Bart's test on the refrigerator, ``Bart Gets an F''
