1. What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?
    Currently the key features would be creating a histogram, and generating a random sentence, and my those are seperated by files.
    I think it also could be turned into a class so the file is more module.

2. Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?
    This is good.

3. What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?
    No globals good scopes.

4. Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?
    Small no side effects.

5. Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?
    Some still could be but almost everything is class based now.

6. Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?
    Yup.

7. Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?
    Depend.
